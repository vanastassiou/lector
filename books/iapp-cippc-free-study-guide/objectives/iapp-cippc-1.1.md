# 1.1: Understand the Canadian governmental structure and its relationship to privacy

Source: IAPP CIPP/C Free Study Guide

## Key concepts

- **Federal system of government**: Canada divides governmental powers between
  federal and provincial/territorial levels, creating a multi-layered privacy
  regulatory environment.
  - Federal government has jurisdiction over federally regulated industries
    (banking, telecommunications, transportation)
  - Provinces and territories have jurisdiction over property, civil rights,
    and matters of a local nature
  - This division directly affects which privacy laws apply to organizations

- **Privacy commissioners**: Independent officers responsible for privacy
  oversight at both federal and provincial levels.
  - Federal: Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada (OPC)
  - Provincial commissioners exist in provinces with their own privacy
    legislation
  - Powers vary by jurisdiction and legislation

- **Provincial privacy oversight alternatives**: In provinces without a
  dedicated privacy commissioner, the Ombudsman office handles privacy
  oversight responsibilities.

- **Substantially similar legislation**: Mechanism where provincial
  private-sector privacy laws can be deemed equivalent to federal law (PIPEDA).
  - Alberta's PIPA, British Columbia's PIPA, and Quebec's Act Respecting the
    Protection of Personal Information in the Private Sector are substantially
    similar
  - When provincial law applies, PIPEDA generally does not apply to
    intra-provincial commercial activities

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Organization operates only within BC | Apply BC PIPA | Provincial substantially similar law applies to intra-provincial commercial activity |
| Federally regulated bank in Alberta | Apply PIPEDA | Federal legislation governs federally regulated industries regardless of province |
| Cross-border data transfer from Quebec | Consider both Quebec law and PIPEDA | PIPEDA applies to interprovincial and international commercial activity |
| Individual seeks recourse in province without privacy commissioner | Contact Ombudsman | Ombudsman handles privacy oversight where no commissioner exists |

## Gotchas

- **Provincial vs. federal jurisdiction**: Organizations cannot simply choose
  which law to follow; jurisdiction is determined by the nature of the
  organization's activities and industry sector.

- **Substantially similar does not mean identical**: Provincial laws deemed
  substantially similar to PIPEDA may have different specific requirements,
  timelines, or enforcement mechanisms.

- **Federal reach**: Even in provinces with substantially similar legislation,
  PIPEDA still applies to federally regulated industries and interprovincial or
  international commercial activities.

## Key concepts

- **Right of correction**: The individual's entitlement under public-sector privacy legislation to request that a government institution correct inaccurate or incomplete personal information held about them
- **Privacy Act foundation**: The right of correction is a core privacy principle under the federal Privacy Act, complementing the right of access
  - Individuals can request corrections to personal information held by federal government institutions
  - Institutions must respond to correction requests within prescribed timelines
- **Provincial/territorial equivalents**: Provincial Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy (FOIPP) Acts contain parallel correction rights for provincially-regulated public bodies

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Individual discovers factual error in government records | Submit formal correction request to the institution | Right of correction enables individuals to maintain accurate records |
| Institution disagrees with requested correction | Document the disagreement; individual may have recourse to Privacy Commissioner | Correction rights include mechanisms for dispute resolution |
| Correction request relates to opinion vs. fact | Distinguish between objective errors and subjective assessments | Right typically applies to factual inaccuracies, not differences of opinion |

## Gotchas

- **Correction vs. deletion**: The right of correction addresses inaccuracies; it is distinct from rights to have information deleted or erased
- **Scope limitations**: Correction rights may be denied in specific circumstances defined by statute
- **Burden of proof**: Individual typically must demonstrate the information is inaccurate or incomplete
- **Notation rights**: Where correction is refused, individuals may have the right to attach a notation or statement of disagreement to their file

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Response timeline | Varies by jurisdiction | Privacy Act specifies 30 days for access requests; correction timelines may differ |
| Exam weight | Domain III covers 11-15 questions | Right of correction is one component of competency III.A |

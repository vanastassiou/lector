The IAPP CIPP/C Free Study Guide is an introductory preparation document that
does not contain substantive content on this objective. The guide covers exam
format, preparation recommendations, and a high-level body of knowledge outline
only.

The relevant content in this source is limited to:

- The body of knowledge outline mentions "privacy principles that are the
  foundation of PIPEDA and provincial private sector laws" without elaborating
  on specific collection, use, disclosure, retention, or deletion rules.
- A sample question references that "PIPEDA applies to any Canadian organization
  that collects, uses or discloses personal information for commercial
  purposes."

For comprehensive coverage of collection limitation, use and disclosure
restrictions, retention requirements, and deletion obligations under PIPEDA and
provincial private-sector laws, refer to the authoritative textbook extract in

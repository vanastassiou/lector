# 2.5: Know that accountability remains with the organization including when using third parties

Source: IAPP CIPP/C Free Study Guide

## Key concepts

- **Accountability principle**: The foundational principle under PIPEDA and the
  CSA Model Code. An organization remains responsible for personal information
  under its control, including information transferred to third parties.
  - Accountability is the first of PIPEDA's 10 principles (Schedule 1)
  - Cannot be delegated or contracted away to service providers
  - Applies throughout the entire data lifecycle

- **Third-party processing**: When an organization transfers personal
  information to another party for processing, the original organization
  retains accountability.
  - Common scenarios: cloud providers, payroll processors, call centers
  - Original organization must ensure third parties provide comparable
    protection
  - Contractual agreements establish third-party obligations

- **Organizational responsibility**: Organizations must designate an individual
  responsible for compliance with privacy principles.
  - Required under PIPEDA Principle 1
  - Applies to all personal information the organization controls
  - Includes oversight of third-party handling

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Outsourcing data processing | Use contracts to ensure comparable protection; maintain oversight | Accountability stays with the original organization |
| Third party experiences a breach | Original organization fulfills breach notification duties | Cannot transfer accountability for the data |
| Vendor wants secondary use of data | Deny unless individuals consented to that purpose | Original purpose limitations still apply |
| Cross-border transfer to processor | Ensure adequate protections regardless of location | Accountability remains domestic |

## Gotchas

- **Contracts do not transfer accountability**: A contract creates obligations
  for the third party but does not shift the organization's fundamental
  responsibility to individuals and regulators.

- **Breach notification remains with you**: Even when a third party causes a
  breach, the original organization must notify affected individuals and the
  OPC as required under PIPEDA.

- **Ongoing oversight required**: Due diligence is not one-time. Organizations
  must monitor third-party compliance throughout the relationship.

- **Individuals complain to you**: Data subjects seeking access or filing
  complaints approach the original organization, not the third-party processor.

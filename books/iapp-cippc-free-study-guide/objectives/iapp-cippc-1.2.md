# 1.2: Apply concepts and development of fair information practices (FIPPs)

Source: IAPP CIPP/C Free Study Guide

## Key concepts

- **CSA Model Code for the Protection of Personal Information**: Referenced as one of
  two Canadian model codes for privacy compliance; forms part of the CIPP/C key subject
  matter areas.
- **Generally Accepted Privacy Principles (GAPP)**: Referenced alongside the CSA Model
  Code as a framework for privacy compliance in Canada.

## Source limitations

The free study guide provides only a brief reference to FIPPs-related frameworks without
substantive content. It lists the CSA and GAPP frameworks as key subject matter areas
but does not explain:

- The history or development of fair information practices
- The OECD Guidelines that influenced Canadian privacy law
- The specific principles within each framework
- How FIPPs map to Canadian legislation

## Related topics

- **PIPEDA Schedule 1**: The free study guide notes that PIPEDA is a key subject
  matter area but does not detail how the CSA Model Code was incorporated as Schedule 1.
- **Provincial private-sector laws**: Alberta PIPA, BC PIPA, and Quebec's private
  sector legislation are mentioned as key subject areas; these laws also implement
  FIPPs-based principles.

## Exam preparation note

The IAPP recommends studying the authoritative textbook "Canadian Privacy: Data
Protection Law and Policy for the Practitioner" for substantive content on this
objective. The free study guide serves as an exam preparation overview rather than a
source of detailed legal content.

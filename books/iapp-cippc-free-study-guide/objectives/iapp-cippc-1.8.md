# 1.8: Understand the complaint and investigation process for privacy breaches

Source: IAPP CIPP/C Free Study Guide

## Key concepts

- **Privacy commissioner oversight**: Canadian privacy commissioners at federal
  and provincial levels are responsible for investigating privacy complaints and
  breaches.
  - Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada (OPC) handles federal matters
  - Provincial commissioners handle matters under provincial legislation
  - Powers vary: federal commissioner makes recommendations; some provincial
    commissioners have order-making authority

- **Ombudsman as alternative oversight**: In provinces without a dedicated
  privacy commissioner, the Ombudsman office handles privacy oversight,
  including complaint intake and investigation.

- **Complaint-driven enforcement model**: The Canadian privacy framework relies
  heavily on individual complaints to trigger investigations.
  - Individuals can file complaints alleging violations of their privacy rights
  - Commissioners may also initiate investigations without a complaint
  - Investigation findings inform organizational compliance

- **Multi-jurisdictional considerations**: Which commissioner handles a
  complaint depends on which law applies to the organization.
  - PIPEDA matters go to the OPC
  - Provincial private-sector matters (Alberta, BC, Quebec) go to provincial
    commissioners
  - Health sector matters go to the relevant provincial health information
    commissioner or authority

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Individual believes a federal organization violated PIPEDA | File complaint with OPC | OPC has jurisdiction over PIPEDA matters |
| Complaint against provincially regulated business in BC | File with BC Information and Privacy Commissioner | BC PIPA applies; provincial commissioner has jurisdiction |
| Privacy violation in province without privacy commissioner | Contact provincial Ombudsman | Ombudsman handles privacy oversight in these jurisdictions |
| Breach at federally regulated bank | Report to OPC regardless of province | Federal legislation governs federally regulated industries |

## Gotchas

- **Recommendation vs. order power**: The federal Privacy Commissioner can only
  make recommendations, not binding orders. Alberta, BC, and Quebec
  commissioners have order-making authority. This fundamental difference affects
  enforcement outcomes.

- **Provincial overlap**: Organizations may need to understand multiple
  complaint processes depending on their operations across provinces with
  different privacy regimes.

- **Not all oversight offices have equal powers**: The Ombudsman model in some
  provinces may have different investigative tools and remedial powers compared
  to dedicated privacy commissioners.

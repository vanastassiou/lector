## Key concepts

- **Health information breach**: Unauthorized access, collection, use,
  disclosure, or disposal of personal health information (PHI), or loss or
  theft of PHI
  - Thresholds and definitions vary by provincial health privacy statute
  - More stringent than general private sector breach definitions under PIPEDA

- **Provincial health privacy statutes with breach notification**:
  - Ontario PHIPA (Personal Health Information Protection Act)
  - Alberta HIA (Health Information Act)
  - Manitoba PHIA (Personal Health Information Act)
  - Saskatchewan HIPA (Health Information Protection Act)
  - Each has distinct notification triggers, timelines, and requirements

- **Custodian vs. agent distinction**:
  - Health information custodian bears primary breach notification
    responsibility
  - Agents (processors) must notify custodians of breaches
  - Contractual requirements should specify breach reporting timelines

- **Notification recipients**:
  - Affected individuals (mandatory in most jurisdictions)
  - Provincial privacy commissioner or regulatory body
  - Professional regulatory bodies (in some cases)
  - Other custodians who may need to take action

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Lost unencrypted USB with patient records | Notify commissioner and affected individuals; assess scope | Most provincial health statutes require notification for loss of PHI |
| Employee snooping in patient records | Investigate, notify affected patients, report to commissioner | Unauthorized access triggers notification even without external disclosure |
| Ransomware attack on health system | Treat as breach; notify commissioner and patients; assess data exfiltration | Encryption by attacker constitutes unauthorized access |
| Misdirected fax with PHI | Assess sensitivity and volume; notify if significant risk | Even routine operational errors can trigger notification obligations |

## Gotchas

- **PIPEDA breach rules don't automatically apply**: Health sector has separate
  statutory frameworks; don't assume PIPEDA's breach provisions govern health
  information custodians
- **Lower thresholds than private sector**: Many health statutes require
  notification for any breach, not just those creating "real risk of
  significant harm"
- **Agent vs. custodian confusion**: Agents must report to custodians, but
  custodians retain notification responsibility to individuals and regulators
- **Electronic vs. paper records**: Breach notification applies equally to both
  formats
- **Commissioner notification timing**: Some statutes require notification "at
  the first reasonable opportunity" rather than fixed timelines

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| PHIPA notification to IPC | At first reasonable opportunity | No fixed timeline |
| Alberta HIA notification | Without unreasonable delay | Risk-based threshold |
| Content of notification | Description of breach, steps taken, contact info | Varies by statute |
| Record retention post-breach | Follow normal retention plus investigation needs | Document response |

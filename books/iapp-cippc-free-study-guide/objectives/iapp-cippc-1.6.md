Source: CIPP/C Free Study Guide (IAPP, 2025)

## Key concepts

- **GAPP as a model code framework**: The study guide identifies GAPP alongside
  the CSA Model Code as one of the "Canadian model codes for privacy compliance"
  that privacy professionals must understand.
  - Listed as key subject matter area for the CIPP/C exam
  - Referenced as a compliance framework alongside CSA Model Code

- **Framework purpose**: GAPP provides standards for privacy compliance in the
  private sector. The guide describes it as a reference for understanding
  foundational privacy principles that inform Canadian legislation.

- **Exam relevance**: The study guide's body of knowledge outline places GAPP
  understanding within Domain I (Introduction to Privacy in Canada), which
  carries a 28% weight on the exam.

- **PIPEDA**: Federal private sector law; GAPP can complement PIPEDA compliance
  but is not a legal substitute
- **Privacy principles development**: GAPP is one framework in the lineage from
  OECD Guidelines to modern Canadian privacy law

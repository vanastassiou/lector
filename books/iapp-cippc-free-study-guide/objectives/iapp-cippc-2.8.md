## Key concepts

- **Meaningful consent**: Consent that an individual provides with genuine
  understanding of what they are agreeing to. Requires clear notice of purposes
  and how personal information will be handled.
- **Valid consent**: Consent obtained in compliance with PIPEDA and provincial
  private sector laws. Must meet form requirements (express or implied) based on
  sensitivity of information and reasonable expectations.
- **Form of consent**: The manner in which consent is obtained - express
  (explicit opt-in) or implied (reasonable inference from actions). Sensitivity
  of information determines which form is required.
- **Consent as a condition of service**: Organizations cannot require consent to
  collection, use, or disclosure beyond what is necessary for the stated
  purpose as a condition of providing a product or service.
- **Opt-out mechanisms**: Methods allowing individuals to withdraw consent for
  certain uses of their personal information. Must be clear, accessible, and
  easy to use.
- **New purposes**: When an organization wants to use personal information for a
  purpose not identified at the time of collection, it must obtain fresh consent
  before that new use.

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Collecting sensitive information (health, financial) | Obtain express consent | Sensitivity requires explicit agreement |
| Marketing to existing customers | Provide clear opt-out mechanism | Implied consent may exist but must be easy to withdraw |
| Changing how collected data will be used | Obtain new consent before new use | Original consent does not cover new purposes |
| Requiring consent for unrelated purposes | Do not tie consent to service provision | Cannot bundle unrelated consents |

## Gotchas

- **Trap: Assuming blanket consent covers all uses**: Original consent is
  limited to stated purposes. Any new purpose requires fresh consent even for
  existing data.
- **Trap: Relying on buried terms**: Consent is not meaningful if the individual
  cannot reasonably understand what they are agreeing to. Privacy policies must
  be clear and accessible.
- **Trap: Making opt-out difficult**: Opt-out mechanisms must be as easy as
  opting in. Complex or hidden withdrawal processes undermine valid consent.

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Express consent requirement | Sensitive information | Health, financial, children's data |
| Implied consent acceptable | Non-sensitive, reasonable expectations | Routine commercial transactions |
| Consent withdrawal | Must be honoured | Subject to legal or contractual restrictions |

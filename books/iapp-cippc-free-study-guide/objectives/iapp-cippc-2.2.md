# 2.2: Understand the scope of application of PIPEDA and substantially similar laws

Source: IAPP CIPP/C Free Study Guide

## Key concepts

- **PIPEDA applies to commercial activities**: PIPEDA governs organizations that
  collect, use, or disclose personal information for commercial purposes.
  - This is the primary jurisdictional trigger for PIPEDA
  - Non-commercial activities (journalism, personal use) are excluded

- **Provincial private-sector laws**: Several provinces have enacted their own
  private-sector privacy legislation:
  - Alberta's Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA)
  - British Columbia's Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA)
  - Quebec's Act Respecting the Protection of Personal Information in the
    Private Sector

- **Substantially similar designation**: When a province enacts privacy
  legislation deemed "substantially similar" to PIPEDA, the provincial law
  applies to intra-provincial commercial activities instead of PIPEDA.
  - BC, Alberta, and Quebec have substantially similar private-sector laws
  - PIPEDA continues to apply to interprovincial and international activities

- **Body of knowledge focus**: The CIPP/C exam tests candidates on "when
  private-sector legislation is applicable instead of PIPEDA" (BOK item II.B).

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Applicable law | Why |
| -------- | -------------- | --- |
| Commercial activity in province with substantially similar law | Provincial law | Local commercial activity defers to provincial legislation |
| Commercial activity crossing provincial borders | PIPEDA | Interprovincial commerce remains under federal jurisdiction |
| Federally regulated business (banking, telecom) | PIPEDA | Federal industries always subject to PIPEDA regardless of province |

## Gotchas

- **Commercial purpose is key**: PIPEDA applies to commercial activities. The
  example question in the study guide tests whether candidates understand this
  fundamental scope requirement.

- **Substantially similar does not mean identical**: Provincial laws may have
  provisions that differ from PIPEDA while still providing comparable
  protections.

- **Dual compliance possible**: Organizations operating across provincial
  borders may need to comply with both PIPEDA (for interprovincial activities)
  and provincial law (for local activities).

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Provinces with substantially similar private-sector laws | 3 | BC, Alberta, Quebec |
| PIPEDA application | Commercial activities | Non-commercial activities excluded |
| Federal industries | Always PIPEDA | Banking, telecom, interprovincial transport |

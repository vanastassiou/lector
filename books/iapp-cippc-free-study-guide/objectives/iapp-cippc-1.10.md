Source: IAPP CIPP/C Free Study Guide (Effective September 2025)

## Coverage note

The IAPP CIPP/C Free Study Guide is an introductory document that provides exam
preparation guidance and body of knowledge overview. It does not contain
substantive content on court decisions, commissioner rulings, or case law
interpretation.

The study guide explicitly notes these scope limitations:

> This study guide is introductory. Substantive legal content requires the
> official textbook. The guide does not cover:
> - Case law or enforcement decisions
> - Detailed compliance procedures

## Key subject areas referenced

The free study guide identifies the following as key subject matter for the
CIPP/C certification:

- **Roles and oversight powers of Canadian information and privacy
  commissioners**: The guide notes this as a key area without elaborating on
  specific rulings or their interpretive significance.

- **Private-sector laws**: PIPEDA, Alberta PIPA, BC PIPA, and Quebec's Act
  Respecting the Protection of Personal Information in the Private Sector are
  listed, but court interpretation of these statutes is not addressed.

- **Public-sector laws**: The Federal Privacy Act and provincial access laws are
  referenced without discussion of judicial or commissioner interpretation.

## Related exam content

The body of knowledge outline in the free study guide places this objective
within Domain I: Introduction to Privacy in Canada (28% weight), which covers:

- Canadian governmental structure

For substantive content on court and commissioner rulings, consult:

## Practical note for exam preparation

significance of court and commissioner rulings requires study beyond this
introductory guide.

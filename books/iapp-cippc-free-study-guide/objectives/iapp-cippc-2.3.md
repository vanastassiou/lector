# 2.3: Know which private sector industries fall under federal vs provincial laws

Source: IAPP CIPP/C Free Study Guide

## Source limitation

The free study guide provides only introductory exam preparation information. It
does not contain substantive content on federal vs provincial jurisdiction over
private-sector industries. See the BOK extraction for detailed coverage.

## Key concepts

- **PIPEDA scope**: The study guide notes that PIPEDA applies to "any Canadian
  organization that collects, uses or discloses personal information for
  commercial purposes."
  - This establishes federal jurisdiction over commercial data handling
  - Provincial substantially similar laws (Alberta PIPA, BC PIPA, Quebec) may
    apply instead for intra-provincial activity

- **Provincial private-sector laws**: Three provinces have their own
  private-sector legislation recognized as substantially similar to PIPEDA.
  - Alberta PIPA
  - British Columbia PIPA
  - Quebec's Act Respecting the Protection of Personal Information in the
    Private Sector

## Decision heuristics

| When | Do | Because |
| ---- | -- | ------- |
| Organization collects data for commercial purposes | Apply PIPEDA or provincial equivalent | PIPEDA governs commercial collection, use, and disclosure |
| Province has substantially similar legislation | Check if provincial law applies instead of PIPEDA | Alberta, BC, and Quebec have their own private-sector laws |

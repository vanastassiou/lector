# 4.4: Understand consent requirements specific to health sector

Source: IAPP CIPP/C Free Study Guide (Effective September 2025)

## Key concepts

- **Health information privacy statutes**: The study guide identifies four
  provincial health privacy laws that CIPP/C candidates must understand:
  - Ontario's Personal Health Information Protection Act (PHIPA)
  - Alberta's Health Information Act (HIA)
  - Manitoba's Personal Health Information Act (PHIA)
  - Saskatchewan's Health Information Protection Act (HIPA)

- **Domain IV focus**: The body of knowledge outline lists Domain IV as
  "Canadian Privacy Laws and Practices - Health Sector" with the objective to
  "Understand when to apply the various health privacy acts of the provinces
  and territories."

## Source limitations

The free study guide is an exam overview document, not instructional material.
It identifies the statutes covered by the CIPP/C exam but does not provide
substantive content on health sector consent requirements. For detailed
coverage of:

- Express versus implied consent
- Circle of care concept
- Consent for minors and incapable individuals
- Consent withdrawal procedures
- Statutory exceptions to consent

Consult the official textbook: "Canadian Privacy: Data Protection Law and
Policy for the Practitioner" or the IAPP CIPP/C Body of Knowledge.

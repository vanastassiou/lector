# 2.9: Recognize when consent requirements may have exceptions

Source: IAPP CIPP/C Free Study Guide

## Source limitation

The IAPP CIPP/C Free Study Guide is an introductory document that provides exam
structure and preparation guidance. It does not contain substantive legal
content on consent exceptions under PIPEDA or provincial private sector laws.

The guide explicitly notes: "Substantive legal content requires the official
textbook" (Canadian Privacy: Data Protection Law and Policy for the
Practitioner).

## What the source covers

The free study guide identifies that Domain II (Private-Sector Laws and
Practices) includes:

- Privacy principles foundational to PIPEDA and provincial private sector laws
- When private-sector legislation applies instead of PIPEDA
- Canada's Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL)

It confirms that PIPEDA "applies to any Canadian organization that collects,
uses or discloses personal information for commercial purposes" but does not
elaborate on consent exceptions.

## Key concepts (from domain context)

Based on the body of knowledge outline, this objective falls within:

- **Domain II: Canadian Privacy Laws and Practices - Private Sector**
- **Weight**: 19% of exam content
- **Focus area**: PIPEDA principles and provincial private sector laws

The body of knowledge indicates candidates must "know the privacy principles
that are the foundation of PIPEDA and provincial private sector laws," which
includes understanding when consent is required and when exceptions apply.

## Recommended supplementary sources

For substantive content on consent exceptions, consult:

- IAPP CIPP/C Body of Knowledge extract for objective 2.9
- "Canadian Privacy: Data Protection Law and Policy for the Practitioner"
  (official CIPP/C textbook)
- PIPEDA sections 7(1), 7(2), and 7(3) directly

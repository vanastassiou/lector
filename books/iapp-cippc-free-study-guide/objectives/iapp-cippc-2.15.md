## Key concepts

- **Breach of security safeguards**: Under PIPEDA, a breach occurs when personal
  information is lost, accessed without authorization, or disclosed without
  authorization in circumstances where a reasonable person would consider there
  is a real risk of significant harm to an individual.
- **Mandatory notification**: PIPEDA requires organizations to notify affected
  individuals and the Privacy Commissioner of Canada when a breach creates a
  real risk of significant harm.
- **Record-keeping requirement**: Organizations must maintain records of all
  breaches of security safeguards, regardless of whether notification was
  required.
- **Provincial variations**: Alberta, BC, and Quebec have their own breach
  notification requirements that may differ from PIPEDA in timing, thresholds,
  or content requirements.

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Breach with real risk of significant harm | Notify OPC and affected individuals as soon as feasible | PIPEDA mandatory notification threshold met |
| Breach with no real risk of significant harm | No notification required, but must record the breach | Record-keeping obligation applies to all breaches |
| Third party experiences breach of your data | Original organization fulfills notification duties | Accountability remains with the data controller |
| Province has substantially similar law | Follow provincial requirements where applicable | Provincial law may supersede PIPEDA |

## Gotchas

- **All breaches must be recorded**: Even when notification is not required,
  organizations must document every breach in a breach record.
- **"As soon as feasible" is not a fixed timeline**: Unlike some provincial
  laws, PIPEDA does not specify an exact number of days for notification.
- **Significant harm includes more than financial**: Harm can include bodily
  harm, humiliation, damage to reputation, or damage to relationships.
- **Third-party processors do not eliminate your obligations**: When a service
  provider causes a breach, the original organization retains notification
  responsibilities.

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| PIPEDA notification timeline | "As soon as feasible" | No fixed day count |
| Record retention | Minimum 24 months | Must maintain breach records |
| Real risk threshold | Reasonable person standard | Whether harm is likely |
| Quebec Law 25 timeline | 72 hours | Provincial requirement differs from PIPEDA |

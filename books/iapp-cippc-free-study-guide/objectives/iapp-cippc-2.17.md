# 2.17: Understand Canada's Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL)

Source: IAPP CIPP/C Free Study Guide

## Key concepts

- **CASL scope**: Canada's Anti-Spam Legislation governs commercial electronic
  messages (CEMs) sent to or from Canada.
  - Part of Domain II: Canadian Privacy Laws and Practices - Private Sector
  - Distinct from PIPEDA but related to commercial privacy practices
  - Focuses on consent, identification, and unsubscribe mechanisms

- **Consent requirements**: CASL establishes rules for obtaining consent before
  sending commercial electronic messages.
  - Express consent: Explicit permission obtained from the recipient
  - Implied consent: Permitted in specific circumstances (existing business
    relationship, conspicuous publication of address)
  - Consent must be obtained before sending CEMs

- **Identification requirements**: Senders must clearly identify themselves in
  commercial electronic messages.
  - Include sender's name and contact information
  - Identify the person on whose behalf the message is sent (if applicable)

- **Unsubscribe mechanisms**: CASL mandates functional opt-out mechanisms in
  all CEMs.
  - Must be clearly presented in every message
  - Must remain functional for at least 60 days after message is sent
  - Unsubscribe requests must be processed within 10 business days

- **Computer programs**: CASL regulates the installation of computer programs
  on devices.
  - Consent required before installing programs on another person's computer
  - Applies to automatic downloads and software installations
  - Covers malware, spyware, and other unauthorized software

## Common scenarios

| Scenario                                   | Correct approach                          | Why                                        |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Sending promotional email to new contact   | Obtain express consent first              | No prior relationship means no implied consent |
| Existing customer relationship             | Implied consent may apply                 | Business relationship exception exists     |
| Recipient requests unsubscribe             | Process within 10 business days           | CASL mandates timely processing            |
| Installing software on user's device       | Obtain consent before installation        | CASL covers computer program installation  |
| Contact address published on website       | May qualify for implied consent           | Conspicuous publication exception          |

## Gotchas

- **CASL vs. PIPEDA distinction**: CASL specifically targets commercial
  electronic messages and computer programs, while PIPEDA covers broader
  personal information handling - they are complementary but distinct laws
- **Geographic scope**: CASL applies to messages sent to or from Canada,
  capturing organizations outside Canada that send to Canadian recipients
- **Implied consent limits**: Implied consent has time limits and specific
  conditions - it does not provide indefinite permission
- **Computer program consent**: Consent requirements extend beyond email to
  software installation, including updates and bundled programs

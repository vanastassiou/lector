# 4.3: Know health privacy laws across provinces and territories

Source: IAPP CIPP/C Free Study Guide

## Source limitation

The IAPP CIPP/C Free Study Guide provides only a high-level overview of exam
topics without substantive content on provincial health privacy legislation.
This extract documents what the source contains.

## Key concepts

- **Provincial health privacy statutes**: The guide identifies four key
  provincial health privacy laws that candidates should know:
  - Ontario's Personal Health Information Protection Act (PHIPA)
  - Alberta's Health Information Act (HIA)
  - Manitoba's Personal Health Information Act (PHIA)
  - Saskatchewan's Health Information Protection Act (HIPA)

- **Exam domain weight**: The health sector domain represents 11% of the CIPP/C
  examination, indicating moderate coverage within the overall certification.

- **Body of knowledge objective**: The official objective states candidates
  should "Understand when to apply the various health privacy acts of the
  provinces and territories" -- focusing on applicability rather than detailed
  statutory provisions.

## Common scenarios

| Scenario                              | Correct approach                           | Why                                        |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Health data in Ontario                | Apply PHIPA                                | Provincial health law takes precedence     |
| Health data in Alberta                | Apply HIA                                  | Province-specific health legislation       |
| Health data in Manitoba               | Apply PHIA                                 | Manitoba's dedicated health privacy law    |
| Health data in Saskatchewan           | Apply HIPA                                 | Saskatchewan's health information statute  |

## Gotchas

- **Source depth**: The free study guide does not explain the scope, consent
  requirements, or enforcement mechanisms of each provincial law. Candidates
  must consult the official textbook or other sources for substantive content.

- **Incomplete coverage**: The guide mentions only four provincial statutes.
  Other provinces and territories may have relevant legislation or rely on
  general public-sector privacy laws for health information.

## Related topics

- PIPEDA: Federal private-sector law that may apply to health information in
  provinces without substantially similar provincial legislation
- Provincial private-sector laws: Alberta's PIPA, BC's PIPA, and Quebec's
  private-sector law may intersect with health privacy requirements
- Public-sector privacy laws: Provincial freedom of information and protection
  of privacy acts may govern health information held by government institutions

Note: For exam preparation on this objective, candidates should consult
"Canadian Privacy: Data Protection Law and Policy for the Practitioner" or the
more detailed CIPP/C Body of Knowledge materials, which provide the substantive
content required to understand when each provincial health privacy act applies.

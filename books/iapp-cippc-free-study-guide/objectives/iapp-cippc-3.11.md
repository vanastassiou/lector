# 3.11: Know provincial and territorial public sector privacy legislation

Source: IAPP CIPP/C Free Study Guide

## Key concepts

- **Provincial/territorial public sector privacy coverage**: The CIPP/C exam covers
  the applicability of Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Acts across
  provinces and territories
  - Listed as objective III.C in the body of knowledge
  - Falls within Domain III: Canadian Privacy Laws and Practices - Public-Sector
  - Exam questions may address any topic within this domain

- **Scope in this source**: The free study guide identifies this topic area but does
  not provide substantive coverage
  - Detailed statutory content requires the official textbook: "Canadian Privacy:
    Data Protection Law and Policy for the Practitioner"
  - The guide explicitly notes it does not cover specific provisions of each statute

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Need to understand provincial FIPPA details | Consult official CIPP/C textbook | Free study guide is introductory only |
| Identifying which province's law applies | Determine which level of government controls the institution | Jurisdiction based on constitutional division of powers |

## Gotchas

- **Source limitation**: The free study guide mentions provincial public sector laws
  in the body of knowledge outline but provides no substantive detail. Relying solely
  on this source is insufficient for exam preparation on this objective.

- **Textbook required**: The guide explicitly recommends studying "Canadian Privacy:
  Data Protection Law and Policy for the Practitioner" for comprehensive coverage.

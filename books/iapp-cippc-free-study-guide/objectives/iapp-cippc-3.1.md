## Key concepts

- **Privacy Act scope**: Federal public-sector legislation governing how
  government institutions collect, use, and disclose personal information
- **Access rights**: Individuals have the right to request access to personal
  information held by government institutions
- **Response timeline**: Government institutions must respond to access requests
  within 30 days

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Individual requests personal information from federal agency | Agency must respond within 30 days | Privacy Act mandates this timeline |

## Gotchas

- **30 days, not 45**: The Privacy Act requires a 30-day response window for
  access requests, which differs from some provincial timelines

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Access request response time | 30 days | From receipt of request |

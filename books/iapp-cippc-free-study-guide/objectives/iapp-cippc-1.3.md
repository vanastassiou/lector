# 1.3: Know the OECD Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and their eight principles

Source: IAPP CIPP/C Free Study Guide (2025)

## Source limitation

The IAPP free study guide is an introductory document that does not contain
substantive content on the OECD Guidelines. The guide mentions "Understand the
development of privacy principles" as a topic within Domain I but provides no
detail on the OECD framework or its eight principles.

For exam-relevant content on this objective, refer to the authoritative textbook:
"Canadian Privacy: Data Protection Law and Policy for the Practitioner."

## Available context from source

The body of knowledge outline identifies Domain I.C as "Understand the development
of privacy principles." This domain carries 28% exam weight, indicating significant
coverage of foundational privacy frameworks including international guidelines.

The study guide references two Canadian model codes for privacy compliance:

- CSA Model Code for the Protection of Personal Information
- Generally Accepted Privacy Principles (GAPP)

Both frameworks derive from OECD principles, but the free study guide does not
elaborate on this connection.

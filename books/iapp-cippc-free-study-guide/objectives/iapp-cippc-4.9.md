# 4.9: Identify differences between health sector and general privacy requirements

Source: IAPP CIPP/C Free Study Guide

## Source limitation

The IAPP Free Study Guide is a preparation overview document that does not contain
substantive content for this objective. The guide only references that the CIPP/C
covers "select health information privacy statutes such as Ontario's PHIPA,
Alberta's HIA, Manitoba's PHIA and Saskatchewan's HIPA" without explaining the
differences between health sector and general privacy requirements.

For detailed content on this objective, refer to the primary textbook: "Canadian
Privacy: Data Protection Law and Policy for the Practitioner."

## Key concepts (from body of knowledge outline)

- **Health privacy statutes**: Provincial health information acts (PHIPA, HIA,
  PHIA, HIPA) govern health information separately from general private-sector
  laws like PIPEDA or provincial PIPAs.
- **Scope difference**: Health sector laws apply to health information custodians
  (hospitals, physicians, pharmacies) while general laws apply to commercial
  activities broadly.
- **Sensitivity recognition**: Health information receives heightened protection
  due to its sensitive nature, with stricter consent and disclosure requirements.

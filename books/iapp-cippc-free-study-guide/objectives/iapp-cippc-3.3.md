## Key concepts

- **PIPEDA scope**: Federal private-sector legislation applying to organizations
  that collect, use, or disclose personal information in the course of
  commercial activities
- **Privacy Act scope**: Federal public-sector legislation governing how
  government institutions handle personal information
- **Sector distinction**: PIPEDA regulates private-sector commercial activities;
  Privacy Act regulates federal government institutions
- **Commercial activity requirement**: PIPEDA applies only to commercial
  purposes, not journalistic, artistic, literary, or personal use

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Applicable law | Why |
| -------- | -------------- | --- |
| Private company collecting customer data for sales | PIPEDA | Commercial activity in private sector |
| Federal department maintaining citizen records | Privacy Act | Federal government institution |
| Provincial government health agency | Neither (provincial law applies) | Falls under provincial public-sector legislation |
| Private company collecting data for internal HR | May be exempt from PIPEDA | Employee records in provincially-regulated workplaces excluded |

## Gotchas

- **Commercial purpose is key for PIPEDA**: The exam tests whether you can
  identify that PIPEDA applies to "commercial purposes" specifically, not all
  organizational activities
- **Provincial carve-outs**: Organizations in provinces with "substantially
  similar" legislation (Quebec, Alberta, BC) may be subject to provincial
  private-sector laws instead of PIPEDA for intra-provincial activities
- **Federal vs provincial jurisdiction**: Federally-regulated industries
  (banking, telecommunications, transportation) remain under PIPEDA regardless
  of province

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Privacy Act response time | 30 days | For access requests to federal institutions |
| PIPEDA enforcement | OPC recommendations | Commissioner issues findings, not binding orders |
| Privacy Act oversight | Privacy Commissioner of Canada | Same commissioner oversees both acts |

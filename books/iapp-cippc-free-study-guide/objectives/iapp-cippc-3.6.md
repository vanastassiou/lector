# 3.6: Understand the individual's right of access to their personal information

Source: IAPP CIPP/C Free Study Guide

## Key concepts

- **Right of access under the Privacy Act**: Individuals may request access to
  personal information held about them by federal government institutions
  - This is a fundamental right within the public-sector privacy framework
  - Access requests are a core component of Domain III (Public-Sector Laws and
    Practices) on the CIPP/C exam

- **30-day response timeline**: Government institutions must respond to access
  requests within 30 calendar days
  - This is explicitly tested on the exam (see example question in study guide)
  - The timeline applies to federal institutions under the Privacy Act
  - Provincial FOIPPAs may have different response periods

- **Privacy Act as foundation**: The Privacy Act establishes privacy principles
  for the federal public sector, including access rights
  - One of three main components of Domain III alongside PIAs and provincial
    FOIPPAs
  - Candidates must distinguish between federal Privacy Act requirements and
    provincial legislation

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Individual requests access to personal information from government institution | Respond within 30 days | Privacy Act requirement; explicitly tested on exam |
| Question asks about response timeline for federal access request | Select 30 days (not 10, 15, or 45) | Study guide example question confirms this value |
| Determining which law governs access request | Identify whether federal or provincial institution | Privacy Act applies to federal; provincial FOIPPAs apply to provincial bodies |

## Gotchas

- **30 days is the federal standard**: The specific 30-day timeline applies to
  the federal Privacy Act. Provincial and territorial Freedom of Information
  and Protection of Privacy Acts may specify different response periods. Exam
  questions may test the distinction between federal and provincial
  requirements.

- **Access rights differ by sector**: The right of access under the Privacy Act
  (public sector) operates separately from access provisions under PIPEDA
  (private sector) or provincial health privacy laws. Candidates must identify
  the correct legal framework based on the institution type.

- **Response timeline is a maximum**: The 30 days represents the deadline for
  response, not a standard processing time.

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Response deadline | 30 calendar days | Federal Privacy Act requirement |
| Governing law | Privacy Act | For federal government institutions |
| Provincial equivalent | FOIPPAs | May have different timelines |

  access rights within the public-sector framework
- **Objective 3.2 - Scope of the Privacy Act**: Determines when federal access
  rights apply vs provincial legislation

  request correction after obtaining access

  Distinct access provisions under FOIPPAs

Note: The CIPP/C Free Study Guide provides limited coverage of this objective.
The 30-day response timeline is confirmed via the example exam question. For
detailed treatment of access request procedures, exemptions, identity
verification, and information format requirements, refer to the official CIPP/C
textbook "Canadian Privacy: Data Protection Law and Policy for the
Practitioner."

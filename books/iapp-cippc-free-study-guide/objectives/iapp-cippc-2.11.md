# 2.11: Maintain openness in policies concerning personal information collection

Source: IAPP CIPP/C Free Study Guide

## Key concepts

- **Openness principle**: The study guide identifies "private-sector privacy laws
  such as PIPEDA" as a key subject matter area. PIPEDA Schedule 1 includes the
  openness principle (Principle 4.8), which requires organizations to make their
  privacy policies and practices readily available to individuals.
  - Transparency in how personal information is collected, used, and disclosed
  - Policies must be understandable and accessible
  - Links to CSA Model Code and GAPP frameworks for privacy compliance

- **CSA Model Code relevance**: The study guide lists "Canadian model codes for
  privacy compliance such as the CSA and GAPP frameworks" as key knowledge
  areas. The CSA Model Code includes openness as a core principle that was
  incorporated into PIPEDA.
  - CSA Principle 8 covers openness requirements
  - Organizations must be open about policies concerning personal information
  - Individuals have a right to know about organizational privacy practices

- **Body of knowledge coverage**: The CIPP/C body of knowledge outline specifies
  that candidates must "Know the privacy principles that are the foundation of
  the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)."
  Openness is one of these foundational principles.

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Preparing for CIPP/C exam | Study PIPEDA Schedule 1 principles | Openness is a testable principle |
| Understanding CSA Model Code | Review all ten principles including openness | Foundation of Canadian privacy law |
| Reviewing provincial laws | Check BC PIPA, Alberta PIPA, Quebec Law 25 | Each has openness/transparency requirements |

## Gotchas

- **Exam scope note**: The free study guide provides only high-level topics. The
  official textbook "Canadian Privacy: Data Protection Law and Policy for the
  Practitioner" contains detailed content on the openness principle.

- **Provincial variations exist**: The study guide identifies BC PIPA, Alberta
  PIPA, and Quebec's private sector law as key areas. Each has distinct
  transparency and openness requirements that may appear on the exam.

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| PIPEDA principle number | 8 | Schedule 1, Principle 4.8 |
| Exam domain | II. Canadian Privacy Laws and Practices - Private-Sector | 19% of exam |
| Primary textbook | Canadian Privacy: Data Protection Law and Policy | Required for detailed study |

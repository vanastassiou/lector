# 3.2: Understand the scope and application of the Privacy Act

Source: IAPP CIPP/C Free Study Guide

## Key concepts

- **Privacy Act**: Federal legislation governing personal information held by
  government institutions
  - Applies to federal government institutions, not private sector
  - Part of the public-sector privacy framework in Canada
  - Works alongside provincial Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy
    Acts at the provincial/territorial level

- **Access rights**: Individuals have the right to request access to their
  personal information held by government institutions
  - Government institutions must respond within 30 days (exam-tested timeframe)

- **Oversight**: The Privacy Commissioner of Canada oversees compliance with the
  Privacy Act
  - In provinces without a dedicated privacy commissioner, the Ombudsman handles
    privacy oversight

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Individual requests access to personal information from federal government | Process request and respond within 30 days | Privacy Act mandates this response timeline |
| Determining oversight body in province without privacy commissioner | Look to the Ombudsman | Default oversight structure in those jurisdictions |
| Organization collects data for commercial purposes | Apply PIPEDA, not Privacy Act | Privacy Act covers government, not commercial activity |

## Gotchas

- **Privacy Act vs. PIPEDA**: The Privacy Act applies only to federal government
  institutions. Commercial activities fall under PIPEDA or provincial
  private-sector laws, not the Privacy Act.

- **Response timeline**: The 30-day response requirement is a specific,
  exam-tested detail. Do not confuse with other timelines in Canadian privacy
  law.

- **Provincial variation**: Provincial and territorial governments are covered
  by their own Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Acts, not the
  federal Privacy Act.

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Access request response time | 30 days | Federal government institutions under Privacy Act |

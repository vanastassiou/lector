## Key concepts

- **International privacy standards**: Frameworks developed by international
  bodies that establish baseline privacy principles applicable across
  jurisdictions
  - Canadian privacy law draws heavily from these international foundations
  - The CSA Model Code (referenced in the study guide) incorporates OECD
    principles
  - PIPEDA's ten fair information principles align with international standards

- **When to apply international standards**:
  - Cross-border data transfers requiring adequacy assessments
  - Organizations operating in multiple jurisdictions
  - Gaps in domestic legislation where international guidance applies
  - Compliance programs seeking interoperability with foreign regimes

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Data transfer to non-adequate country | Apply contractual safeguards based on international principles | PIPEDA requires comparable protection |
| Multi-national compliance program | Map controls to both Canadian law and international frameworks | Demonstrates due diligence across jurisdictions |
| Interpreting ambiguous PIPEDA provisions | Reference OECD Guidelines as interpretive aid | PIPEDA was modeled on these principles |

## Gotchas

- **International standards are not directly enforceable in Canada**: They
  inform but do not replace PIPEDA, provincial PIPs, and sector-specific laws
- **"Substantially similar" does not mean identical**: Provincial laws deemed
  substantially similar to PIPEDA may differ in specific requirements while
  meeting the overall standard
- **Adequacy is not permanent**: International adequacy determinations can
  change; organizations must monitor developments

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| PIPEDA fair information principles | 10 | Based on CSA Model Code, which incorporates OECD principles |
| Provincial substantially similar laws | 3 (AB, BC, QC private sector) | Each has distinct requirements despite similar foundation |

  guide as compliance model

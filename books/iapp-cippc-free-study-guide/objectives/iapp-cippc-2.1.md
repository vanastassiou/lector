# 2.1: Know the privacy principles that are the foundation of PIPEDA

Source: IAPP CIPP/C Free Study Guide

## Key concepts

- **PIPEDA foundation**: The Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents
  Act (PIPEDA) is a federal private-sector privacy law governing the collection, use,
  and disclosure of personal information in commercial activities.
  - Applies to organizations collecting, using, or disclosing personal information for
    commercial purposes
  - Provincial private-sector laws (Alberta PIPA, BC PIPA, Quebec's Act Respecting the
    Protection of Personal Information in the Private Sector) may apply instead of
    PIPEDA in certain jurisdictions

- **CSA Model Code**: The Canadian Standards Association Model Code for the Protection
  of Personal Information serves as a foundational privacy framework.
  - Referenced as one of the "Canadian model codes for privacy compliance"
  - Provides principles that inform PIPEDA's structure

- **GAPP framework**: The Generally Accepted Privacy Principles framework is another
  Canadian model code for privacy compliance.

## Common scenarios

| Scenario                                              | Correct approach                     | Why                                      |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Organization collects personal information for sales  | Apply PIPEDA requirements            | Commercial purpose triggers PIPEDA       |
| Organization in BC collects customer data             | Determine if BC PIPA or PIPEDA apply | Provincial law may supersede PIPEDA      |
| Organization needs compliance framework               | Reference CSA Model Code and GAPP    | These codes inform Canadian privacy law  |

## Gotchas

- **PIPEDA scope limitation**: PIPEDA applies to commercial activities only - do not
  confuse with public sector requirements under the Privacy Act
- **Provincial overlap**: Organizations must determine whether PIPEDA or a provincial
  private-sector law applies based on jurisdiction and activity type

## Limits and defaults

| ----------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| PIPEDA application      | Commercial purposes          | Federal private-sector law         |
| Provincial alternatives | Alberta, BC, Quebec          | Substantially similar legislation  |
| Model codes             | CSA Model Code, GAPP         | Foundational compliance frameworks |

# 1.9: Know recent legal developments and court decisions affecting privacy law

Source: IAPP CIPP/C Free Study Guide

## Key concepts

- **Evolving Canadian privacy legislation**: Canadian privacy law continues to
  develop through new legislation and amendments. The study guide references
  private-sector laws (PIPEDA, Alberta's PIPA, BC's PIPA, Quebec's Act
  Respecting the Protection of Personal Information) as key exam areas,
  indicating the importance of understanding how these laws have evolved.

- **Quebec's Act Respecting the Protection of Personal Information in the
  Private Sector**: Quebec's law underwent significant modernization through
  Law 25 (Bill 64), introducing enhanced requirements.
  - Mandatory Privacy Impact Assessments for high-risk processing
  - Stricter consent and transparency requirements
  - Administrative monetary penalties up to CAD 25 million or 4% global revenue
  - Extraterritorial application to organizations processing Quebec residents'
    data

- **Role of commissioners in shaping privacy law**: Privacy commissioners
  contribute to legal development through investigations, findings, and
  guidance. The study guide highlights "roles and oversight powers of Canadian
  information and privacy commissioners" as key subject matter.
  - OPC findings interpret PIPEDA provisions
  - Provincial commissioners (Alberta, BC, Quebec) can issue binding orders
  - Published decisions establish compliance expectations

- **Court decisions on privacy matters**: Courts interpret privacy statutes
  and resolve disputes. The Federal Court has jurisdiction over PIPEDA appeals;
  provincial courts address provincial privacy legislation.
  - Judicial decisions establish binding precedent
  - Courts clarify statutory ambiguities
  - Decisions shape what constitutes valid consent and reasonable expectations

- **Federal privacy law reform**: Ongoing efforts to modernize PIPEDA reflect
  legal development in Canada. Bill C-27 proposed the Consumer Privacy
  Protection Act (CPPA) and the Artificial Intelligence and Data Act (AIDA) as
  part of the Digital Charter Implementation Act.
  - Proposed administrative monetary penalties
  - Enhanced protections for minors
  - New AI governance requirements

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Quebec enacts new privacy requirements | Review compliance for Quebec residents regardless of org location | Quebec law has extraterritorial reach |
| Privacy Commissioner publishes new findings | Update practices to align with interpretation | Commissioner findings guide compliance expectations |
| Court decision interprets PIPEDA provision | Revise policies to reflect judicial interpretation | Court decisions establish binding precedent |
| Proposed legislation reaches final reading | Prepare implementation plans | Organizations need lead time to adapt programs |
| Provincial law introduces order-making authority | Recognize increased enforcement risk | Binding orders carry greater compliance obligations |

## Gotchas

- **Provincial developments have national impact.** Quebec's Law 25 affects any
  organization with Quebec customers, regardless of where the organization is
  located. Provincial legal changes can force national compliance updates.

- **Federal commissioner recommendations vs. provincial commissioner orders.**
  The OPC can only recommend under PIPEDA, but Alberta, BC, and Quebec
  commissioners can issue binding compliance orders. Enforcement outcomes
  differ significantly between jurisdictions.

- **Legislative reform timelines are uncertain.** Proposed federal reforms
  (CPPA/AIDA) have not yet passed. Organizations should monitor developments
  but cannot assume specific implementation dates.

- **"Recent" is relative to exam date.** The CIPP/C exam is updated
  periodically. Legal developments considered "recent" depend on when the body
  of knowledge was last revised. Check the effective date of exam materials.

- **Court decisions are context-specific.** Similar facts may yield different
  outcomes based on circumstances. Courts apply contextual analysis to privacy
  expectations, so no universal rule applies across all situations.

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Quebec Law 25 AMPs | Up to CAD 25 million or 4% global revenue | Whichever is greater |
| PIPEDA Federal Court appeal deadline | 1 year from Commissioner's final report | For judicial review |
| Alberta/BC commissioner authority | Binding compliance orders | Can require specific remedial actions |
| OPC authority under PIPEDA | Recommendations only | No order-making power |
| Proposed CPPA AMPs | Up to CAD 25 million or 5% global revenue | If Bill C-27 passes as proposed |

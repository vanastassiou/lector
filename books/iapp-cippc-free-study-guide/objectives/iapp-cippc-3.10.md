# 3.10: Know required contents of a PIA report

Source: IAPP CIPP/C Free Study Guide

## Key concepts

- **Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA)**: A systematic evaluation of privacy risks
  for a government program, system, or activity
  - Falls under Domain III: Canadian Privacy Laws and Practices - Public Sector
  - Part of the "Conduct privacy impact assessments" competency area
  - Applies to federal government institutions under the Privacy Act framework

- **PIA as a public sector requirement**: The body of knowledge positions PIAs
  as a core public-sector practice
  - Distinct from private-sector privacy management approaches
  - Linked to Privacy Act principles (Objective 3.1)
  - Part of the 12% weighting for the Public-Sector domain

- **Report vs process distinction**: Objective 3.10 specifically addresses
  report contents, not the broader PIA process
  - When to complete a PIA is covered separately (Objective 3.9)
  - Report contents focus on what must be documented
  - Exam questions may test specific required elements

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Question asks what must be included in a PIA report | Identify core required elements: program description, PI inventory, risk analysis, mitigations | Report must document complete privacy assessment |
| Question distinguishes PIA process from PIA report | Focus on documentation requirements for report questions | Process (when/how) vs contents (what) are separate objectives |
| Federal vs private sector privacy assessment | PIA requirements apply to federal public sector | Private sector may do privacy assessments but federal PIA has specific requirements |

## Gotchas

- **PIA reports have specific required contents**: The objective tests knowledge
  of what elements must be documented in a PIA report. Generic "privacy
  assessment" knowledge is insufficient; candidates must know the specific
  components required for federal government PIAs.

- **Public sector focus**: This objective falls under Domain III (Public
  Sector). PIA report requirements derive from federal government policy,
  primarily the Treasury Board Directive on Privacy Impact Assessment. Do not
  confuse with private-sector privacy assessments under PIPEDA.

- **Companion to Objective 3.9**: Objectives 3.9 (how and when to complete a
  PIA) and 3.10 (required contents) are related but distinct. Exam questions
  may require distinguishing between process/timing questions and content
  requirements.

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Domain | III - Public Sector | 12% exam weight |
| Governing legislation | Privacy Act | Federal public sector |
| Policy framework | Treasury Board directives | Defines PIA requirements |
| Related objective | 3.9 - How and when to complete a PIA | Process companion |

## Related topics

- **Objective 3.1 - Privacy Act principles**: Foundation for understanding what
  PIAs must assess compliance against
- **Objective 3.9 - How and when to complete a PIA**: Companion objective
  covering timing and triggers
- **Objective 3.8 - Storage, retention, and destruction of personal
  information**: PIA reports must address data lifecycle
- **Domain II - Private-Sector Laws**: Contrast federal PIA requirements with
  private-sector privacy practices

Note: The CIPP/C Free Study Guide provides minimal coverage of this objective,
listing only "Conduct privacy impact assessments" as a body of knowledge item
without elaboration. For detailed treatment of required PIA report contents,
including specific elements mandated by Treasury Board policy (program
description, personal information inventory, privacy analysis, risk assessment,
mitigation measures, retention provisions, access procedures, and governance
accountability), refer to the official CIPP/C textbook "Canadian Privacy: Data
Protection Law and Policy for the Practitioner."

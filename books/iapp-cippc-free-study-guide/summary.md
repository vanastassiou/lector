preparation requires understanding jurisdictional differences between federal and
provincial laws, with a minimum of 30 hours of study recommended.

## Key frameworks

  - Questions may come from any topic within each domain
  - The integrated exam blueprint indicates item distribution across domains

### Canadian privacy model codes

- **Name**: CSA and GAPP Frameworks

## Decision heuristics

| When | Do | Because |
| ---- | -- | ------- |
| Organization collects data for commercial purposes | Apply PIPEDA (or provincial equivalent) | PIPEDA governs commercial collection, use, and disclosure |
| Province has substantially similar legislation | Check if provincial law applies instead of PIPEDA | Alberta, BC, and Quebec have their own private-sector laws |
| Processing health information | Identify applicable provincial health act | Each province has distinct health privacy legislation |
| Responding to access request under Privacy Act | Respond within 30 days | Federal requirement for government institutions |
| Province lacks privacy commissioner | Ombudsman has oversight responsibility | Default oversight structure in some jurisdictions |

## Memorable formulations

- "PIPEDA applies to any Canadian organization that collects, uses or discloses
  personal information for commercial purposes."
- "Privacy certification is an important effort that requires advance preparation."

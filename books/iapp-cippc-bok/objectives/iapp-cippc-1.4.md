# 1.4: Understand the CSA Model Code for the Protection of Personal Information

Source: IAPP CIPP/C Body of Knowledge

## Key concepts

- **CSA Model Code for the Protection of Personal Information (CAN/CSA-Q830-96)**:
  Published in 1996 by the Canadian Standards Association, this voluntary standard
  established privacy principles for the private sector. It became the foundation
  for PIPEDA when incorporated as Schedule 1 to the Act in 2000.
  - First comprehensive Canadian privacy code for the private sector
  - Developed through multi-stakeholder consensus (industry, government, consumer
    groups)
  - Directly based on the 1980 OECD Guidelines, adapted for Canadian context
  - Became legally binding when adopted into PIPEDA

- **Relationship to PIPEDA**: The CSA Model Code forms Schedule 1 of PIPEDA. The
  10 principles in the Model Code are the 10 PIPEDA principles. Understanding the
  CSA Code means understanding the core obligations under PIPEDA.
  - Schedule 1 is incorporated by reference into PIPEDA
  - Courts and commissioners interpret PIPEDA principles through the CSA Code text
  - The Model Code provides implementation guidance beyond the principle statements

- **Development context**: Created in response to growing concern about private
  sector data practices in the 1990s, particularly as electronic commerce expanded.
  Canada sought a made-in-Canada approach that aligned with international standards.

## The 10 CSA Model Code principles

1. **Accountability**: An organization is responsible for personal information under
   its control. A designated individual (privacy officer) must be accountable for
   compliance.
   - Accountability continues during transfers to third parties for processing
   - Must implement policies and practices to give effect to principles
   - Must establish complaint handling procedures

2. **Identifying Purposes**: The purposes for collecting personal information must
   be identified at or before the time of collection.
   - Purposes must be documented
   - When a new purpose is identified, consent must be obtained before use
   - Purposes must be specific enough to be meaningful

3. **Consent**: The knowledge and consent of the individual are required for
   collection, use or disclosure (with limited exceptions).
   - Form of consent (express or implied) varies with sensitivity
   - Individuals can withdraw consent subject to legal or contractual restrictions
   - Consent must not be obtained through deception

4. **Limiting Collection**: Collection must be limited to what is necessary for
   identified purposes. Information must be collected by fair and lawful means.
   - No collection "just in case" it might be useful
   - Collection methods must be transparent and appropriate
   - Aligns with OECD Collection Limitation Principle

5. **Limiting Use, Disclosure and Retention**: Personal information shall not be
   used or disclosed for purposes other than those for which it was collected,
   except with consent or as required by law. Information shall be retained only
   as long as necessary.
   - Establishes the linkage between purpose and use
   - Requires retention schedules and destruction procedures
   - Exceptions for legal requirements or consent

6. **Accuracy**: Personal information shall be as accurate, complete and up-to-date
   as necessary for the purposes for which it is to be used.
   - Standard is fitness for purpose, not absolute accuracy
   - Organizations should not routinely update all information
   - Information used for decision-making about individuals requires higher accuracy

7. **Safeguards**: Personal information shall be protected by security safeguards
   appropriate to the sensitivity of the information.
   - Administrative, technical and physical measures required
   - Employees must understand the importance of confidentiality
   - Security must be proportionate to sensitivity and risk

8. **Openness**: An organization shall make readily available specific information
   about its policies and practices relating to the management of personal
   information.
   - Must be understandable and accessible to individuals
   - Includes contact information for the privacy officer
   - Privacy policies should not be hidden or overly legalistic

9. **Individual Access**: Upon request, an individual shall be informed of the
   existence, use and disclosure of their personal information and given access.
   Individuals can challenge accuracy and completeness.
   - Response must be timely and at minimal or no cost
   - Information must be in understandable form
   - Limited exceptions exist (legal privilege, third-party information)

10. **Challenging Compliance**: An individual shall be able to address a challenge
    concerning compliance to the designated accountable individual.
    - Organizations must have complaint procedures
    - All complaints must be investigated
    - Must inform individuals of avenues for recourse (e.g., Privacy Commissioner)

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| No privacy officer designated | Appoint one immediately | Accountability: must have designated individual |
| Collecting SIN for loyalty program | Do not collect; SIN not necessary | Limiting Collection: must be necessary for purpose |
| Using customer data for new product development | Obtain fresh consent first | Identifying Purposes / Consent: new purpose requires new consent |
| Third-party processor receives data | Ensure contractual protections | Accountability: organization remains responsible |
| Customer requests access to their file | Respond within 30 days with the information | Individual Access: timely response required |
| Sensitive health data stored on laptop | Encrypt and apply enhanced security | Safeguards: proportionate to sensitivity |

## Gotchas

- **CSA Code vs. PIPEDA**: The CSA Model Code IS the PIPEDA principles (Schedule 1).
  Some exam questions may phrase things in terms of "CSA principles" while others
  use "PIPEDA principles" - they are the same 10 principles.

- **Voluntary origin, mandatory application**: The CSA Code was originally
  voluntary. When incorporated into PIPEDA, it became legally enforceable. Don't
  confuse the voluntary origins with the current mandatory status.

- **Ten principles vs. eight OECD principles**: The CSA/PIPEDA framework has 10
  principles; the OECD Guidelines have 8. The CSA Code expanded and adapted the
  OECD framework. Know the count difference.

- **Accountability as first principle**: Unlike the OECD Guidelines (where
  accountability is the eighth principle), the CSA Code places Accountability
  first, emphasizing organizational responsibility as the foundation for all other
  principles.

- **Consent is not absolute**: The CSA Code allows exceptions to consent in limited
  circumstances (legal requirements, emergencies, publicly available information).
  Questions may test whether a scenario qualifies for an exception.

- **Purpose limitation is ongoing**: Identifying purposes is not a one-time
  activity. When purposes change, the organization must return to the consent
  principle.

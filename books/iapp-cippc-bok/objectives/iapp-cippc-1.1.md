# 1.1: Understand the Canadian governmental structure and its relationship to privacy

Source: IAPP CIPP/C Body of Knowledge (Version 3.1.0, Effective 1 Sept. 2025)

## Key concepts

- **Constitutional division of powers**: Canada's Constitution Act, 1867 divides
  legislative authority between federal and provincial governments. This division
  directly determines which level of government can enact privacy legislation for
  different sectors and activities.

- **Federal jurisdiction**: The federal government has authority over matters
  including banking, telecommunications, interprovincial transportation, and
  federal government institutions. PIPEDA applies to federally regulated private
  sector organizations and cross-border or interprovincial commercial activities.

- **Provincial jurisdiction**: Provinces have authority over property and civil
  rights, health care, education, and provincially incorporated businesses. This
  enables provinces to enact their own private sector, public sector, and health
  privacy legislation.

- **Civil law vs. common law**: Quebec operates under a civil law system derived
  from French law, while the rest of Canada follows the common law tradition from
  English law. Privacy legislation must be interpreted within the applicable
  legal tradition.
  - Civil law: Codified statutes are the primary source; judicial decisions
    interpret the code
  - Common law: Court decisions (precedent) and statutes both serve as sources
    of law

- **Sources of law in Canada**:
  - Constitutional law (Constitution Act, Charter of Rights and Freedoms)
  - Federal statutes (e.g., PIPEDA, Privacy Act, CASL)
  - Provincial statutes (e.g., Alberta PIPA, BC PIPA, Quebec Law 25)
  - Regulations made under statutes
  - Common law and civil law principles
  - Case law and tribunal decisions

- **Courts**: The Canadian court system includes:
  - Supreme Court of Canada: Final court of appeal for all matters
  - Federal Court and Federal Court of Appeal: Jurisdiction over federal
    government matters, including Privacy Act complaints
  - Provincial superior courts: General jurisdiction over civil and criminal
    matters
  - Provincial courts: Handle most day-to-day matters

- **Administrative tribunals**: Specialized bodies that adjudicate disputes
  within their statutory mandate. In the privacy context, Privacy Commissioners
  function as administrative bodies with investigation and oversight powers,
  though their specific remedial authorities vary by jurisdiction.

- **Privacy Commissioners**: Independent officers responsible for overseeing
  privacy law compliance:
  - Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada (OPC): Oversees PIPEDA and the
    Privacy Act at the federal level
  - Provincial and territorial commissioners: Each province and territory has an
    information and privacy commissioner (or ombudsman) with jurisdiction over
    provincial/territorial public bodies and, where applicable, private sector
    and health sector organizations

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Organization operates only within one province | Determine if provincial "substantially similar" law applies | AB, BC, and QC have private sector laws that apply to intra-provincial commercial activities |
| Federal government department collects personal information | Apply the Privacy Act | Federal public sector is governed by the Privacy Act, not PIPEDA |
| Bank collects customer information | Apply PIPEDA | Banks are federally regulated regardless of where they operate |
| Hospital in Ontario collects patient information | Apply PHIPA (provincial health act) | Health sector has separate provincial legislation |
| Complaint about federal government's handling of personal information | File with OPC under Privacy Act; Federal Court has jurisdiction for appeals | Privacy Act complaints go through federal channels |
| Complaint about provincially regulated organization | File with provincial commissioner | Provincial commissioners oversee organizations under their jurisdiction |

## Gotchas

- **The Charter applies to government action, not private actors.** The Canadian
  Charter of Rights and Freedoms constrains government conduct but does not
  directly apply to private sector organizations. Privacy rights against private
  entities come from statutes like PIPEDA, not the Charter.

- **"Federally regulated" refers to the industry, not the location.** A
  telecommunications company operating only in Alberta is still federally
  regulated because telecommunications is under federal jurisdiction.

- **Provincial commissioners' powers vary significantly.** Some have
  order-making authority (e.g., Alberta, BC, Quebec private sector), while
  others can only make recommendations (e.g., OPC under PIPEDA). Know the
  enforcement model for each jurisdiction.

- **Courts and commissioners have different roles.** Privacy Commissioners
  investigate complaints and make findings or recommendations. Courts provide
  judicial review of commissioner decisions and can award damages in some
  circumstances.

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Federal private sector law | PIPEDA | Applies unless provincial "substantially similar" law governs |
| Federal public sector law | Privacy Act | Covers federal government institutions |
| Provinces with substantially similar private sector laws | AB, BC, QC | Their laws apply to intra-provincial commercial activities |
| Federal court system for Privacy Act | Federal Court | Has jurisdiction over federal government privacy matters |
| Supreme Court of Canada | Final appellate authority | Can hear privacy cases on constitutional or significant legal questions |

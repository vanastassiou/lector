# 2.3: Know which private sector industries fall under federal vs provincial laws

Source: IAPP CIPP/C Body of Knowledge

## Key concepts

- **Constitutional division of powers**: The Canadian Constitution divides
  legislative authority between federal and provincial governments. Privacy
  jurisdiction follows this division, with federally regulated industries
  governed by PIPEDA regardless of provincial substantially similar legislation.
  - Section 91: Federal powers (banking, navigation, interprovincial works)
  - Section 92: Provincial powers (property and civil rights, local matters)
  - Trade and commerce power enables federal privacy regulation of commercial
    activities crossing provincial boundaries

- **Federally regulated industries (always under PIPEDA)**: Certain industries
  fall under exclusive federal jurisdiction as "federal works, undertakings, or
  businesses" and remain subject to PIPEDA even in provinces with substantially
  similar legislation.
  - Banking and financial institutions (chartered banks, federally regulated
    credit unions)
  - Telecommunications (telephone companies, internet service providers,
    broadcasting)
  - Interprovincial and international transportation (airlines, railways,
    interprovincial trucking, marine shipping)
  - Broadcasting (radio, television, cable, satellite)
  - Navigation and shipping
  - Federal Crown corporations and enterprises
  - Uranium mining and atomic energy

- **Provincially regulated industries**: Industries falling under provincial
  jurisdiction are governed by provincial private-sector privacy laws (in BC,
  Alberta, Quebec) or PIPEDA (in provinces without substantially similar laws).
  - Retail and hospitality
  - Manufacturing (except interprovincial distribution)
  - Healthcare delivery (subject to health-specific privacy laws)
  - Real estate
  - Professional services (law, accounting, consulting)
  - Education (private institutions)
  - Insurance (provincially incorporated insurers)
  - Credit unions (provincially regulated)
  - Local transportation (taxis, municipal transit)
  - Construction and trades

- **Employee information jurisdiction**: Employee personal information follows
  the regulatory status of the employer.
  - Federally regulated employers: PIPEDA governs employee information
  - Provincially regulated employers in BC, Alberta, Quebec: Provincial law
    applies
  - Provincially regulated employers elsewhere: PIPEDA does not generally apply
    to employee information (regulatory gap in some provinces)

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Applicable law | Why |
| -------- | -------------- | --- |
| TD Bank branch in Quebec | PIPEDA | Chartered bank is federally regulated |
| Rogers customer in BC | PIPEDA | Telecommunications is federally regulated |
| Air Canada in any province | PIPEDA | Airlines are federally regulated |
| Provincially regulated credit union in Alberta | Alberta PIPA | Not a chartered bank; provincial entity |
| Local taxi company in Quebec | Quebec law | Local transportation is provincial |
| VIA Rail | PIPEDA | Interprovincial railway is federally regulated |
| Private hospital in Ontario | PIPEDA | Ontario lacks substantially similar private-sector law |
| Law firm in Vancouver | BC PIPA | Professional services are provincially regulated |
| Interprovincial trucking company | PIPEDA | Interprovincial transportation is federal |
| Local delivery service in Toronto | PIPEDA | Ontario lacks substantially similar law |

## Gotchas

- **Chartered banks vs. credit unions**: Chartered banks (TD, RBC, BMO) are
  federally regulated and always under PIPEDA. Credit unions are typically
  provincially regulated unless federally incorporated, making them subject to
  provincial law in BC, Alberta, and Quebec.

- **Insurance company complexity**: Federally incorporated insurers fall under
  PIPEDA; provincially incorporated insurers follow provincial law (where
  applicable). An organization must verify incorporation status, not just where
  it operates.

- **Telecommunications includes ISPs**: Internet service providers are part of
  the telecommunications sector and federally regulated. A BC-based ISP remains
  under PIPEDA, not BC PIPA.

- **Broadcasting is broad**: Cable companies, satellite providers, and streaming
  services with broadcasting licenses fall under federal jurisdiction and PIPEDA,
  even for local content delivery.

- **Subsidiary structure matters**: A subsidiary of a federal work may be
  provincially regulated if it operates independently in a provincial sector.
  The regulatory status of the parent does not automatically transfer.

- **Interprovincial vs. local transportation**: A trucking company operating
  only within one province falls under provincial regulation. The same company
  expanding to interprovincial routes becomes federally regulated for those
  activities.

- **Mixed activities**: An organization with both federally and provincially
  regulated activities may face dual compliance obligations. The analysis is
  activity-based, not entity-based.

- **Federal Crown corporations**: Organizations like Canada Post operate under
  PIPEDA regardless of where they conduct business or whether they compete with
  private-sector provincially regulated entities.

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Key federally regulated sectors | 4 | Banking, telecom, transportation, broadcasting |
| Provinces with private-sector substantially similar laws | 3 | BC, Alberta, Quebec |
| Employee info under PIPEDA for federal employers | Yes | Always applies to federally regulated employers |
| Employee info under PIPEDA for provincial employers | No | Except in provinces relying on PIPEDA |
| PIPEDA application in non-substantially-similar provinces | All commercial activity | Includes local transactions |

## Related topics

- **Substantially similar legislation**: Provincial laws that exempt
  organizations from PIPEDA for intra-provincial commercial activity
- **Constitutional jurisdiction**: Section 91 and 92 of the Constitution Act
  determine federal vs. provincial regulatory authority
- **Federal works, undertakings, and businesses**: The constitutional category
  that determines federal jurisdiction over certain industries
- **Interprovincial commerce**: Commercial activity crossing provincial
  boundaries triggers PIPEDA application
- **Employee information**: Different treatment depending on employer's
  regulatory status and province of operation
- **Health-sector laws**: Separate framework of provincial health privacy laws
  with their own substantially similar designations

# 4.2: Understand Ontario's Personal Health Information Protection Act (PHIPA)

Source: IAPP CIPP/C Body of Knowledge (Version 3.1.0, Effective 1 Sept. 2025)

## Key concepts

- **Personal Health Information Protection Act (PHIPA)**: Ontario's health privacy
  legislation, enacted in 2004. PHIPA governs the collection, use, and disclosure
  of personal health information (PHI) by health information custodians in
  Ontario. It was the first comprehensive health privacy statute in Canada.

- **Health information custodian (HIC)**: The entity accountable for PHI under
  PHIPA. Includes:
  - Health care practitioners (physicians, nurses, pharmacists, dentists)
  - Hospitals, psychiatric facilities, and independent health facilities
  - Long-term care homes and retirement homes providing care services
  - Community care access corporations and community health centers
  - Laboratories and specimen collection centers
  - Pharmacies
  - Ambulance services
  - The Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care

- **Agent**: A person authorized by a HIC to collect, use, or disclose PHI on the
  custodian's behalf. Agents must comply with PHIPA and the custodian's policies.
  The custodian remains accountable for agents' actions.

- **Circle of care**: Health care providers involved in an individual's treatment.
  PHI can flow within the circle of care based on implied consent unless the
  individual has expressly withheld or withdrawn consent (lock box).

- **Lock box provision**: An individual's right to expressly withhold or withdraw
  consent for disclosure of PHI within the circle of care. Once invoked, other
  providers cannot access that information without express consent, even for
  treatment purposes.

- **Substantially similar status**: PHIPA is deemed substantially similar to
  PIPEDA for health information in Ontario, meaning PHIPA applies instead of
  PIPEDA to Ontario health information custodians.

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Family physician refers patient to specialist | Implied consent permits disclosure | Both are within circle of care for treatment |
| Patient invokes lock box for psychiatric records | Require express consent before disclosure | Lock box overrides implied consent |
| Hospital discloses PHI for quality improvement | Permitted without consent if de-identified or necessary for specific purpose | Section 37 permits certain internal uses |
| Researcher requests access to PHI | Require REB approval and consent or REB waiver with strict conditions | Research use requires ethics approval |
| Patient requests copy of medical records | Provide access within 30 days | Individuals have right of access under s. 52 |
| Third-party company requests PHI for marketing | Do not disclose without express consent | Marketing is outside permitted purposes |
| Electronic health record vendor accesses PHI | Vendor acts as electronic service provider; must comply with PHIPA requirements | Part V.1 governs electronic health records |
| PHI breach occurs affecting multiple patients | Notify affected individuals, IPC, and contain breach | Mandatory breach notification under s. 12 |

## Gotchas

- **Implied consent has limits.** Implied consent applies only within the circle
  of care for treatment purposes. Disclosure for other purposes (research,
  marketing, insurance) requires express consent or a statutory exception.

- **Consent can be withdrawn at any time.** An individual can withdraw consent
  prospectively. The custodian must stop using or disclosing PHI except where
  required by law.

- **Substitute decision-makers.** If an individual is incapable of consenting,
  PHIPA specifies a hierarchy of substitute decision-makers. The Health Care
  Consent Act, 1996 governs capacity determinations.

- **Retention period is 10 years minimum.** PHIPA requires custodians to retain
  PHI for at least 10 years after the last entry (or 10 years after the
  individual turns 18 if a minor). Regulations may specify different periods.

- **Access requests have a 30-day deadline.** Custodians must respond to access
  requests within 30 days. Extensions up to an additional 30 days are permitted
  in limited circumstances with notice.

- **Fees must be reasonable.** Custodians may charge a fee for access requests,
  but it must be reasonable and cannot exceed the prescribed amount. Fees cannot
  be a barrier to access.

- **IPC has order-making power.** Unlike some provincial commissioners, Ontario's
  Information and Privacy Commissioner can issue binding orders under PHIPA, not
  just recommendations.

- **Electronic health records have additional rules.** Part V.1 of PHIPA governs
  electronic health records, health information networks, and electronic service
  providers with specific consent and audit requirements.

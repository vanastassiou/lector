# 2.7: Identify the purposes for collecting personal information

Source: IAPP CIPP/C Body of Knowledge

## Key concepts

- **Identifying Purposes Principle (PIPEDA Principle 2)**: Organizations must
  identify the purposes for which personal information is collected at or before
  the time of collection.
  - Derived from CSA Model Code Principle 4.2
  - Purposes must be documented and communicated to the individual
  - Foundation for all subsequent use, disclosure, and retention decisions
  - Links directly to consent: meaningful consent requires understanding of
    purpose

- **Timing of purpose identification**: Purposes must be identified before or at
  the time of collection, not retroactively.
  - Cannot collect first and determine purpose later
  - Prohibits "collect now, figure out use later" approaches
  - Must identify purposes before seeking consent
  - Late identification invalidates the consent basis

- **Specificity requirement**: Purposes must be sufficiently specific to be
  meaningful to the individual.
  - Vague purposes like "business purposes" or "to improve our services" are
    inadequate
  - Must explain what the organization will actually do with the information
  - Specific purposes enable meaningful consent
  - OPC guidance: purposes should answer "what will you do with my data?"

- **Documentation of purposes**: Organizations must document identified purposes
  internally and make them available to individuals.
  - Written record of each collection purpose required
  - Supports accountability and openness principles
  - Enables compliance verification and auditing
  - Privacy policies must reflect documented purposes

- **New purpose identification**: When an organization identifies a new purpose
  for previously collected information, fresh consent is required.
  - Cannot expand use beyond originally stated purposes without consent
  - Must notify individual of new purpose before use
  - Individual has right to refuse consent for new purpose
  - Original collection remains valid for original purposes

- **Relationship to other principles**: Purpose identification is foundational
  to PIPEDA compliance and directly enables other principles.
  - Limiting Collection: collection must relate to identified purposes
  - Consent: meaningful consent requires understanding of purposes
  - Use and Disclosure: limited to identified purposes
  - Retention: tied to purpose fulfillment
  - Accuracy: determined by what purposes require

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Collecting email for order confirmation | State: "We collect your email to send order updates and shipping notifications" | Specific purpose enables meaningful consent |
| Retailer wants to use purchase history for marketing | Identify marketing purpose at collection; if not, obtain new consent | Cannot use for unstated purposes |
| Job application collects references | State: "Reference contacts will be used to verify employment history" | Applicant must know purpose before providing information |
| Website collects browsing data | Identify purposes in privacy policy before collection begins | Purpose identification must precede collection |
| Organization wants to share data with partners | Must have identified third-party sharing as a purpose initially | Sharing is a use requiring prior purpose identification |
| Loyalty program collects purchase patterns | Explain all analysis purposes: "We analyze purchases to recommend products and provide personalized offers" | Specify each distinct use |
| Health club collects emergency contact | State: "Emergency contact used only in case of medical emergency during visit" | Narrow purpose limits future use |
| Bank collecting income information | Identify all purposes: credit decisions, regulatory compliance, product offerings | Multiple purposes require complete disclosure |

## Gotchas

- **Generic purposes are insufficient**: "To provide services" or "for business
  purposes" does not satisfy the specificity requirement. The OPC has found such
  statements inadequate because they do not inform individuals of actual uses.

- **Purpose creep invalidates consent**: If an organization uses information for
  purposes beyond those identified, the original consent does not cover the new
  use. This constitutes a PIPEDA violation even if the individual would have
  consented had they been asked.

- **Collection for potential future use is prohibited**: Collecting information
  because it "might be useful someday" without an identified current purpose
  violates the principle. Speculative collection is not permitted.

- **Third-party transfers require purpose identification**: If information will
  be shared with third parties, this must be identified as a purpose. The
  identity of recipients or categories of recipients should be specified.

- **Implied consent does not excuse purpose identification**: Even where implied
  consent is appropriate, the organization must still identify purposes. The
  consent mechanism differs, but the purpose identification requirement remains.

- **Bundled purposes require separate identification**: When information serves
  multiple purposes, each purpose must be separately identified. Individuals
  should understand the full scope of intended uses.

- **Oral identification is permitted but risky**: While PIPEDA does not require
  written notice in all cases, organizations should document that purposes were
  identified and how. Oral identification creates evidence challenges.

- **Statutory collection does not bypass identification**: When collection is
  required by law, the organization must still identify this purpose to the
  individual, even though consent may not be required.

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| When purposes must be identified | At or before collection | Not retroactive |
| Standard for specificity | Meaningful to individual | Generic descriptions insufficient |
| New purpose requires | Fresh consent | Before new use begins |
| Documentation requirement | Written record | Internal and external (privacy policy) |
| Form of identification | Flexible | Written, oral, or implied by context |
| Privacy policy update | Before collection | Reflect purposes before gathering information |

- **Consent (Principle 3)**: Purpose identification is prerequisite to valid
  consent; individuals cannot consent meaningfully without knowing purposes
- **Limiting Collection (Principle 4)**: Collection must be necessary for
  identified purposes; purpose identification constrains what may be collected
- **Limiting Use and Disclosure (Principle 5)**: Information can only be used or
  disclosed for purposes identified at collection, absent new consent
- **Openness (Principle 8)**: Privacy policies must reflect identified purposes
  and be accessible to individuals
- **OPC guidance on consent**: Office of the Privacy Commissioner has issued
  detailed guidance on meaningful consent, emphasizing purpose clarity
- **Privacy notices**: Practical mechanism for communicating purposes to
  individuals at point of collection
- **Purpose limitation under provincial laws**: Alberta, BC, and Quebec private
  sector laws have similar purpose identification requirements with minor
  variations in language

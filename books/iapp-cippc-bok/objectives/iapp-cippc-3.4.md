# 3.4: Understand consent expectations for collection, use, and disclosure

Source: IAPP CIPP/C Body of Knowledge

## Key concepts

- **Consent model in public sector differs from private sector**: The Privacy
  Act does not operate on a consent-based model like PIPEDA
  - Government institutions do not typically seek individual consent before
    collecting, using, or disclosing personal information
  - Authority flows from statutory mandates, not individual consent
  - Personal information handling must be authorized by law or necessary for
    program delivery

- **Collection authority under the Privacy Act**: Section 4 limits collection to
  information that relates directly to an operating program or activity
  - Collection must be necessary for the program or activity
  - No explicit consent requirement; authority is statutory
  - Individuals must be informed of the purpose at or before collection (section
    5)

- **Use limitations**: Personal information can only be used for the purpose for
  which it was collected, or a consistent use
  - Consistent use: a use that has a reasonable and direct connection to the
    original purpose
  - Individual consent is not the primary control mechanism
  - Uses are governed by statutory authority and consistency requirements

- **Disclosure provisions (sections 7-8)**: Personal information may be
  disclosed without consent under enumerated circumstances
  - Section 8(2) lists over 15 specific permitted disclosures
  - Consent is only one of many permitted grounds for disclosure
  - Other grounds include law enforcement, legal proceedings, audits, and
    agreements with provincial governments

- **Notice requirements**: While consent is not required, notice is mandatory
  - Individuals must be informed of the purpose of collection (section 5)
  - Personal Information Banks (PIBs) must be published in Info Source
  - Transparency replaces consent as the primary accountability mechanism

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Collecting information for a new program | Ensure collection relates directly to operating program; provide notice of purpose | Section 4 requires direct relation to program; section 5 requires purpose notification |
| Using collected information for related purpose | Assess whether use is consistent with original purpose | Consistent uses permitted without new consent; must document reasoning |
| External agency requests disclosure | Check section 8(2) for applicable exception | Disclosure permitted only under enumerated exceptions; consent is just one option |
| Individual objects to use of their information | Explain statutory authority and consistent use provisions | Privacy Act does not give individuals a general right to refuse uses authorized by law |

## Gotchas

- **No meaningful consent model**: Unlike PIPEDA, the Privacy Act does not
  require consent for collection, use, or disclosure. Exam questions may test
  whether candidates understand this fundamental difference. Expecting "implied"
  or "express" consent analysis in public sector contexts is incorrect.

- **Notice does not equal consent**: The Privacy Act requires informing
  individuals of collection purposes (section 5), but this is a notice
  requirement, not a consent requirement. Information can still be collected
  regardless of the individual's preference.

- **Consistent use is not a consent exception**: In private sector law, using
  information beyond the original purpose requires consent or an exception.
  Under the Privacy Act, consistent uses are permitted without any consent
  analysis - they are authorized uses, not exceptions.

- **Section 8(2)(a) allows consent-based disclosure**: Consent is one of the
  enumerated disclosure grounds under section 8(2)(a), but it is not required.
  Government institutions may obtain consent for disclosure but are not obligated
  to do so if another exception applies.

- **Provincial public sector laws may differ**: Some provincial FOIPPAs
  incorporate consent elements more similar to private-sector models. The
  Privacy Act's approach is federal-specific. Exam questions may test whether
  candidates can distinguish federal from provincial public-sector requirements.

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Collection authority | Must relate directly to operating program | Section 4; no consent requirement |
| Notice timing | At or before collection | Section 5; must state purpose |
| Consistent use test | Reasonable and direct connection | TBS guidance defines interpretation |
| Disclosure exceptions | 15+ enumerated grounds | Section 8(2); consent is only one option |
| Individual objection right | No general right to refuse | Differs from private sector consent withdrawal |

- **Section 8(2) disclosure exceptions**: Detailed enumeration of when personal
  information may be disclosed without consent; critical for exam questions
  about public sector disclosure authority
- **Privacy Impact Assessments**: Required when programs present privacy risks;
  must assess whether collection authority exists and notice is adequate
- **Info Source and Personal Information Banks**: Publication requirements that
  support transparency as an alternative to individual consent
- **PIPEDA consent requirements**: Contrasting model where consent is the
  default legal basis for personal information handling
- **Objective 3.5**: Specific exceptions permitting collection, use, or
  disclosure without consent - the detailed application of these concepts

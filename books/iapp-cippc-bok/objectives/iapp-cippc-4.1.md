# 4.1: Know what defines personal health information (PHI)

Source: IAPP CIPP/C Body of Knowledge (Version 3.1.0, Effective 1 Sept. 2025)

## Key concepts

- **Personal health information (PHI)**: Information about an identifiable
  individual that relates to their physical or mental health, health care
  history, health services provided, or health care payments. PHI receives
  heightened protection under provincial health privacy legislation due to its
  sensitive nature.

- **Core elements of PHI across provincial health acts**:
  - Information about the individual's physical or mental health condition
  - Health care history and health services provided to the individual
  - Identification of a health care provider who provided services
  - Payments or eligibility for health care coverage
  - Donation of body parts or bodily substances
  - Health care registration information
  - Health numbers or other health identifiers

- **Provincial health privacy acts**: Canada has no federal health privacy law.
  Each province has enacted its own health privacy legislation:
  - Ontario: Personal Health Information Protection Act (PHIPA)
  - Alberta: Health Information Act (HIA)
  - Manitoba: Personal Health Information Act (PHIA)
  - Saskatchewan: Health Information Protection Act (HIPA)
  - New Brunswick: Personal Health Information Privacy and Access Act (PHIPAA)
  - Newfoundland and Labrador: Personal Health Information Act (PHIA)
  - Nova Scotia: Personal Health Information Act (PHIA)

- **Health information custodian**: The entity responsible for PHI under
  provincial health acts. Custodians include:
  - Health care practitioners (physicians, nurses, pharmacists)
  - Hospitals and health facilities
  - Laboratories
  - Pharmacies
  - Long-term care facilities
  - Health care agencies and government health ministries

- **Identifiability requirement**: Information qualifies as PHI only when it
  relates to an identifiable individual. De-identified or anonymized health
  data that cannot reasonably be linked back to an individual is not PHI.

- **Distinction from general personal information**: PHI is a subset of personal
  information with specific statutory treatment. While PIPEDA or provincial
  private sector laws govern general personal information, health privacy acts
  apply specifically to PHI held by health information custodians.

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Hospital records containing diagnosis and treatment | Treat as PHI under applicable provincial health act | Medical records are core PHI regardless of format |
| Employer obtains doctor's note for sick leave | General personal information under PIPEDA or provincial private sector law | Employer is not a health information custodian |
| Pharmacy prescription records | PHI under provincial health act | Pharmacies are health information custodians; prescriptions reveal health conditions |
| Health insurer claim records | May be PHI if insurer is designated custodian; otherwise governed by insurance privacy rules | Varies by province; some include insurers as custodians |
| Research using de-identified health data | Not PHI if properly de-identified | Identifiability is required for PHI status |
| Fitness tracker data held by technology company | Not PHI; general personal information | Technology company is not a health information custodian |
| Mental health counseling records | PHI under provincial health act | Mental health is explicitly included in PHI definitions |

## Gotchas

- **Not all health-related information is PHI.** Information only qualifies as
  PHI when held by a health information custodian in the health care context.
  The same information (e.g., a diagnosis) held by an employer or insurer may
  be governed by different legislation.

- **Provincial definitions vary in scope.** Each provincial health act has its
  own PHI definition. Some are broader (including billing and payment
  information) while others are narrower. Know the specific elements covered by
  the applicable provincial act.

- **Health care providers vs. health information custodians.** Not all health
  care providers are custodians under every provincial act. The designation
  depends on the provincial legislation and can affect which law applies.

- **Registration information is PHI.** Information collected when an individual
  registers for health services (name, address, health card number) is PHI
  because it reveals the individual's interaction with the health system.

- **Genetic information receives special treatment.** Most provincial health
  acts explicitly include genetic information as PHI, and some impose
  additional restrictions on its collection, use, and disclosure.

- **Deceased individuals may be covered.** Some provincial health acts protect
  PHI of deceased individuals for a specified period. The protection may pass
  to executors or personal representatives.

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Federal health privacy law | None | Health privacy is provincially regulated |
| Ontario health privacy act | PHIPA | Personal Health Information Protection Act, 2004 |
| Alberta health privacy act | HIA | Health Information Act |
| Manitoba health privacy act | PHIA | Personal Health Information Act |
| Saskatchewan health privacy act | HIPA | Health Information Protection Act |
| Health number as PHI | Yes | Provincial health card numbers are explicitly PHI |
| Mental health records | PHI | Included in all provincial PHI definitions |
| Genetic information | PHI | Explicitly included in most provincial acts |

  based on implied consent, which differs from express consent requirements for
  other disclosures (Objective 4.6)

- **Collection, use, and disclosure of PHI**: Understanding what constitutes PHI
  is prerequisite to applying rules for handling it (Objective 4.2)
- **Safeguarding and breach protocols**: PHI breach notification requirements

# 3.2: Understand the scope and application of the Privacy Act

Source: IAPP CIPP/C Body of Knowledge

## Key concepts

- **Privacy Act (R.S.C., 1985, c. P-21)**: Federal legislation governing how
  government institutions collect, use, disclose, retain, and dispose of
  personal information
  - Enacted in 1983, came into force July 1, 1983
  - Applies exclusively to federal government institutions listed in the
    Schedule to the Act
  - Does not apply to private sector organizations (covered by PIPEDA) or
    provincial/territorial public bodies

- **Personal information under the Privacy Act**: Information about an
  identifiable individual that is recorded in any form
  - Includes name, address, age, education, employment history, financial
    information, medical history, criminal record
  - Excludes information about federal employees related to their position or
    functions (e.g., job title, business contact information)

- **Government institution**: Any department or ministry of state of the
  Government of Canada, or any body or office listed in the Schedule to the
  Privacy Act
  - Includes departments, agencies, Crown corporations, and other federal
    bodies
  - The Schedule is periodically updated to add or remove institutions

- **Privacy Commissioner of Canada**: Independent Officer of Parliament who
  oversees compliance with the Privacy Act
  - Investigates complaints from individuals
  - Conducts audits and reviews
  - Makes recommendations (not binding orders) to government institutions
  - Can apply to the Federal Court in certain circumstances

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Individual requests access to their personal information | Respond within 30 days of receipt | Privacy Act section 14 mandates this timeline; extensions possible in limited circumstances |
| New federal program collects personal information | Complete Privacy Impact Assessment before implementation | TBS Directive requires PIAs for new or substantially modified programs |
| Third party requests disclosure of personal information | Assess against specific exemptions in sections 7-8 | Disclosure without consent permitted only under enumerated exceptions |
| Personal information no longer needed for original purpose | Dispose of according to retention schedules | Section 6(3) requires disposal when no longer required |

## Gotchas

- **Privacy Act vs. PIPEDA**: The Privacy Act applies only to federal
  government institutions, not private sector organizations. A common exam trap
  conflates these two regimes. PIPEDA governs commercial activities; the
  Privacy Act governs federal public sector.

- **30-day response timeline**: The Privacy Act requires response within 30
  calendar days, not business days. This differs from some provincial
  legislation. Extensions are permitted but require notification.

- **Recommendations vs. orders**: The Privacy Commissioner can only make
  recommendations under the Privacy Act, not binding orders. This contrasts
  with some provincial commissioners who have order-making power.

- **Institutions covered**: Not all federal entities are covered. The Schedule
  to the Act must be checked to confirm coverage. Some entities may be added or
  removed over time.

- **Employee information exception**: Information about federal employees
  related to their position or functions is not considered personal
  information for Access to Information Act purposes, but this exception is
  narrower under the Privacy Act.

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Response time for access requests | 30 days | From date of receipt; calendar days |
| Time extension with notice | 30 additional days | For consultations or voluminous requests |
| Complaint filing deadline | 1 year | From refusal or failure to respond |
| Records retention | Per institution schedules | Must follow Treasury Board guidelines |
| Federal Court application deadline | 45 days | After receiving Commissioner's report |

# 3.6: Understand the individual's right of access to their personal information

Source: IAPP CIPP/C Body of Knowledge

## Key concepts

- **Right of access under the Privacy Act (section 12)**: Individuals have a
  statutory right to request access to personal information about themselves
  held by federal government institutions
  - Right applies to Canadian citizens, permanent residents, and any individual
    present in Canada
  - Request must be made in writing to the appropriate government institution
  - Institutions must provide access unless a specific exemption applies
  - Access right is fundamental to transparency and accountability in the
    public sector

- **Personal Information Banks (PIBs)**: Government institutions maintain
  registered collections of personal information organized by program
  - Info Source publication describes PIBs and how to access them
  - Individuals should identify the relevant PIB when making access requests
  - PIBs help requesters locate their personal information across government
  - Institutions must describe their PIBs in publicly accessible directories

- **Response timeline - 30 days**: Government institutions must respond to
  access requests within 30 calendar days of receipt
  - Extensions permitted where searching records would unreasonably interfere
    with operations
  - Extensions permitted for consultation with other institutions or third
    parties
  - Requester must be notified of any extension and provided a new deadline
  - Privacy Commissioner may review complaints about delayed responses

- **Identity verification**: Institutions must verify the requester's identity
  before disclosing personal information
  - Reasonable steps to confirm identity required to prevent unauthorized
    disclosure
  - Methods may include government-issued identification, knowledge-based
    verification, or in-person attendance
  - Verification must balance security with accessibility
  - Over-verification can itself be a barrier to access rights

- **Right to information in intelligible form**: Information must be provided
  in a form the individual can understand
  - Where information is in coded format, institution must provide explanation
  - Technical or specialized terminology should be clarified
  - Translations may be required for official languages

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Individual requests their employment records from a federal department | Accept request in writing; respond within 30 days; verify identity before disclosure | Standard access request procedure under section 12 |
| Requester provides insufficient identification | Request additional verification; do not deny access solely on this basis | Verification is procedural, not a bar to the access right |
| Records contain both requester's and third party's personal information | Sever third party information before disclosure; provide requester's information | Section 19 exemption for third party information; access right applies to requester's own information |
| Response requires consultation with another department | Extend timeline; notify requester of extension and new deadline | Consultation extension permitted under section 9 |
| Requester alleges delayed response | Privacy Commissioner may investigate complaint | Commissioner oversight ensures compliance with timelines |
| Individual cannot locate appropriate PIB | Assist in identifying relevant information holdings; Info Source is the starting point | Institutions have duty to assist requesters |

## Gotchas

- **30 days is a maximum, not a target**: The Privacy Act requires response
  within 30 days. Institutions should respond as quickly as possible; 30 days
  is the outer limit absent a valid extension. Exam questions may test whether
  candidates understand this is a ceiling, not a standard processing time.

- **Extensions are not automatic**: Extensions must be justified by specific
  circumstances (volume of records, consultation requirements). An institution
  cannot routinely extend every request. The Privacy Commissioner scrutinizes
  extension practices.

- **Third party information must be severed, not refused entirely**: When
  records contain both the requester's and a third party's personal
  information, the institution must provide the requester's information after
  removing the third party content. Complete refusal is not appropriate.

- **Access is to personal information, not documents**: The right is to
  personal information about the requester, not necessarily complete documents.
  Non-personal information or exempt portions may be removed from disclosed
  records.

- **Provincial public bodies follow different timelines**: The 30-day timeline
  applies to federal institutions under the Privacy Act. Provincial FOIPPAs
  may specify different response periods. Exam questions may distinguish
  between federal and provincial requirements.

- **Oral requests are insufficient**: The Privacy Act requires written requests.
  Institutions may have duty to assist individuals in formulating requests,
  but the formal request must be in writing.

- **Fee prohibition for personal information**: Unlike access to general
  government records under the Access to Information Act, individuals cannot
  be charged fees for accessing their own personal information under the
  Privacy Act.

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Response deadline | 30 calendar days | From receipt of request |
| Extension authority | Permitted with justification | Must notify requester |
| Request format | Written | Oral requests insufficient |
| Fees | Prohibited | No charge for personal information access |
| Third party information | Severed before disclosure | Section 19 exemption |
| Identity verification | Required | Reasonable steps before disclosure |
| Form of access | Intelligible | Must provide explanation of codes/terms |
| Oversight | Privacy Commissioner | May investigate complaints |

  may request correction after obtaining access to inaccurate information
- **Objective 3.5 - Collection and disclosure without consent**: Access rights
  operate alongside non-consent-based information handling
- **Section 19 exemptions for third party information**: Limits on access where
  disclosure would reveal third party personal information
- **Privacy Impact Assessments**: Should address how access requests will be
  handled for new programs
- **Info Source**: Published directory of government information holdings that
  supports access right exercise
- **PIPEDA access rights (Principle 9)**: Private-sector parallel with different
  procedural requirements; 30-day timeline also applies under PIPEDA

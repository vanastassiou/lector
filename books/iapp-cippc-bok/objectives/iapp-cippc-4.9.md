# 4.9: Identify differences between health sector and general privacy requirements

Source: IAPP CIPP/C Body of Knowledge (Version 3.1.0, Effective 1 Sept. 2025)

## Key concepts

- **Different legislative frameworks**: Health sector privacy is governed by
  provincial health privacy acts (PHIPA, HIA, PHIA, HIPA), while general
  private-sector privacy is governed by PIPEDA or provincial private-sector laws
  (Alberta PIPA, BC PIPA, Quebec Law 25). These regimes operate independently
  with distinct terminology, obligations, and oversight mechanisms.

- **Personal health information (PHI) vs personal information (PI)**: Health
  acts use the term "personal health information" with specific statutory
  definitions covering health status, health services, and health care payments.
  PIPEDA and private-sector laws use "personal information" as a broader
  category. PHI is a subset of PI that receives heightened protection.

- **Custodians vs organizations**: Health acts impose obligations on "health
  information custodians" (physicians, hospitals, pharmacies, health ministries).
  PIPEDA imposes obligations on "organizations" engaged in commercial activity.
  The same entity may be subject to both regimes for different types of
  information.

- **Circle of care and implied consent**: Health sector allows implied consent
  for disclosures within the circle of care for treatment purposes. PIPEDA has
  no equivalent concept; implied consent is narrower and based on reasonable
  expectations in commercial contexts, not care relationships.

- **Consent model differences**: Health acts permit broad implied consent for
  treatment purposes; express consent is required for disclosures outside the
  circle of care. PIPEDA requires consent to be appropriate to the sensitivity;
  opt-out may suffice for less sensitive information in commercial contexts.

- **Breach notification thresholds**: Some provincial health acts (e.g., Ontario
  PHIPA) require notification to the Commissioner for all theft, loss, or
  unauthorized access, regardless of harm. PIPEDA requires notification only when
  there is a "real risk of significant harm." Health sector thresholds are often
  more stringent.

- **Oversight authority**: Health acts assign oversight to provincial
  Information and Privacy Commissioners or Ombudsmen. PIPEDA assigns oversight
  to the federal Privacy Commissioner. Different commissioners have different
  powers, investigation procedures, and enforcement approaches.

## Comparative summary

| Aspect | Health sector | General private sector (PIPEDA) |
| ------ | ------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Governing law | Provincial health privacy acts (PHIPA, HIA, etc.) | PIPEDA or substantially similar provincial law |
| Terminology | Personal health information (PHI), custodian | Personal information (PI), organization |
| Implied consent scope | Circle of care for treatment | Reasonable expectations in commercial context |
| Express consent trigger | Disclosure outside circle of care | Sensitive information or new purposes |
| Breach notification | All theft/loss/access (Ontario) or risk of harm | Real risk of significant harm only |
| Oversight | Provincial IPC or Ombudsman | Federal Privacy Commissioner |
| Access request timeline | Varies by province (often 30-45 days) | 30 days (PIPEDA s. 8) |
| Employee information | Covered if held by custodian | Generally excluded from PIPEDA |

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Physician discloses patient records to another treating physician | Implied consent under health act | Circle of care permits disclosure for treatment |
| Retailer shares customer data with affiliate for marketing | Express consent under PIPEDA required | No circle of care concept; new purpose requires consent |
| Hospital laptop with unencrypted patient data is stolen | Notify IPC and affected individuals under health act | Health acts often have lower notification thresholds |
| Insurance company loses customer financial data | Assess real risk of significant harm before notifying | PIPEDA harm threshold applies to non-health sector |
| Employer requests employee's medical records from physician | Express consent required under health act | Employer is outside circle of care; health act applies |
| Bank collects customer SIN for account opening | Implied consent may apply under PIPEDA | Reasonable expectation in commercial context for regulatory compliance |
| Pharmacy sells de-identified prescription data | Depends on adequacy of de-identification | Must meet health act de-identification standards, not just PIPEDA |

## Gotchas

- **Same information, different regime.** A diagnosis on a hospital record is
  PHI under the health act; the same diagnosis on an employer's sick leave form
  is PI under PIPEDA. The legal regime depends on who holds the information and
  in what context.

- **Substantially similar does not mean identical.** Provincial private-sector
  laws (Alberta PIPA, BC PIPA) are deemed substantially similar to PIPEDA but
  have their own requirements. Do not assume PIPEDA rules apply to provincially
  regulated private-sector activity.

- **Circle of care has no private-sector equivalent.** Implied consent for
  treatment disclosures is a health-sector-only concept. Businesses cannot claim
  "circle of care" to justify sharing customer data without consent.

- **Breach notification timelines differ.** Ontario PHIPA recommends 72-hour
  notification to the IPC for breaches. PIPEDA specifies "as soon as feasible"
  with no fixed timeline. Do not apply PIPEDA timelines to health-sector
  breaches.

- **Health acts may cover non-commercial activity.** PIPEDA applies to
  commercial activity only. Health acts apply to custodians regardless of
  whether the activity is commercial. A hospital's treatment of patients is
  governed by the health act even if no payment is involved.

- **Access request fees differ.** Some health acts prohibit or limit fees for
  PHI access requests. PIPEDA permits reasonable cost-recovery fees. Know the
  applicable fee rules for each regime.

- **Research exemptions differ.** Health acts have specific provisions for
  research ethics board approval and consent waivers. PIPEDA's research
  exemptions are narrower and less detailed.

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| PIPEDA access request response | 30 days | May extend with notice |
| Ontario PHIPA access request response | 30 days | Standard timeline |
| PIPEDA breach notification threshold | Real risk of significant harm | Risk-based assessment required |
| Ontario PHIPA IPC notification | All theft, loss, or unauthorized access | Lower threshold than PIPEDA |
| PIPEDA oversight | Federal Privacy Commissioner | Ombudsman model; no order-making power |
| Ontario PHIPA oversight | Ontario IPC | Order-making power for health information |
| Circle of care concept | Health sector only | Not applicable under PIPEDA |
| Custodian concept | Health sector only | PIPEDA uses "organization" |

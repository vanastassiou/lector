# 1.3: Know the OECD Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and their eight principles

Source: IAPP CIPP/C Body of Knowledge

## Key concepts

- **OECD Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal
  Data**: Adopted in 1980 by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
  Development, these guidelines represent the first internationally agreed-upon
  framework for privacy protection. Updated in 2013 to address modern data
  processing practices.
  - Established the foundation for fair information practices worldwide
  - Non-binding but highly influential in shaping national privacy laws
  - Canada was a founding participant and signatory
  - Directly influenced the development of PIPEDA and the CSA Model Code

- **Purpose of the OECD Guidelines**: Harmonize national privacy legislation while
  preventing unjustified barriers to transborder data flows. Balance individual
  privacy rights with the free flow of information necessary for international
  commerce.

## The eight OECD privacy principles

1. **Collection Limitation Principle**: Personal data should be obtained by lawful
   and fair means and, where appropriate, with the knowledge or consent of the data
   subject.
   - Limits on what can be collected, not just how it is used
   - Consent should be meaningful and informed
   - Lawfulness requirement addresses both legal authority and ethical collection

2. **Data Quality Principle**: Personal data should be relevant to the purposes for
   which it is used and, to the extent necessary, should be accurate, complete and
   kept up-to-date.
   - Organizations must ensure fitness for purpose
   - Inaccurate data can cause harm to individuals
   - Obligation to maintain and correct data as needed

3. **Purpose Specification Principle**: The purposes for collection should be
   specified no later than the time of collection. Subsequent use should be limited
   to fulfilling those purposes or compatible purposes.
   - Requires clear articulation of why data is needed
   - Prevents function creep and unauthorized repurposing
   - Purposes must be specified before or at collection, not after

4. **Use Limitation Principle**: Personal data should not be disclosed, made
   available or used for purposes other than specified except with data subject
   consent or by authority of law.
   - Complements the Purpose Specification Principle
   - Two exceptions: consent and legal authority
   - Applies to both internal use and external disclosure

5. **Security Safeguards Principle**: Personal data should be protected by
   reasonable security safeguards against risks such as loss, unauthorized access,
   destruction, use, modification or disclosure.
   - Risk-based approach to security
   - Must address multiple threat types
   - "Reasonable" implies proportionality to sensitivity and context

6. **Openness Principle**: There should be a general policy of openness about
   developments, practices and policies regarding personal data. Means should be
   readily available to establish the existence and nature of personal data, the
   main purposes of use, and the identity and location of the data controller.
   - Transparency requirement for organizations
   - Individuals should be able to discover who holds their data
   - Supports informed consent and access rights

7. **Individual Participation Principle**: An individual should have the right to:
   - Obtain confirmation of whether a data controller holds their data
   - Have data communicated within a reasonable time, at reasonable cost, in
     intelligible form
   - Be given reasons if a request is denied, with ability to challenge denial
   - Challenge data and have it erased, rectified, completed or amended

8. **Accountability Principle**: A data controller should be accountable for
   complying with measures that give effect to the other principles.
   - Organizations must take responsibility for compliance
   - Cannot delegate accountability even when outsourcing processing
   - Foundation for demonstrable compliance and governance programs

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Marketing wants to use HR data for campaigns | Deny unless new consent obtained | Use Limitation: original purpose was employment, not marketing |
| Collecting "nice to have" fields on forms | Remove non-essential fields | Collection Limitation: only collect what is necessary |
| Third-party vendor receives customer data | Ensure vendor accountability contractually | Accountability: controller remains responsible |
| Data breach occurs | Report as required; review security measures | Security Safeguards: must protect against unauthorized access |
| Customer cannot understand privacy policy | Rewrite in plain language | Openness: means must be "readily available" and intelligible |

## Gotchas

- **Principles are interconnected**: Purpose Specification and Use Limitation work
  together - you cannot have one without the other. Exam questions may test whether
  a scenario violates one or both.

- **Collection Limitation vs. Data Minimization**: The OECD principle focuses on
  lawfulness and consent at collection; data minimization (a related but distinct
  concept) focuses on limiting collection to what is necessary. The OECD principle
  is broader.

- **Accountability is about the controller**: Even when processing is outsourced,
  the original data controller remains accountable. This is distinct from having a
  contract in place.

- **2013 Updates added new dimensions**: The 2013 revision added guidance on
  privacy management programs, data security breach notification, and national
  privacy strategies - expect questions on the evolution of the Guidelines.

- **Non-binding but foundational**: The OECD Guidelines are recommendations, not
  law. However, they directly influenced binding legislation like PIPEDA, which
  incorporated the principles through the CSA Model Code.

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Original adoption year | 1980 | First international privacy framework |
| Major revision year | 2013 | Added accountability provisions and breach notification |
| Number of core principles | 8 | Often tested as a specific count |
| Binding status | Non-binding | Recommendations, not treaty obligations |

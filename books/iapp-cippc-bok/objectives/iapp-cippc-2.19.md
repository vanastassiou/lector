# 2.19: Know provincial private sector laws (Alberta PIPA, BC PIPA, Quebec Law 25)

Source: IAPP CIPP/C Body of Knowledge

## Key concepts

- **Substantially similar designation**: Provincial private sector privacy laws
  may be deemed "substantially similar" to PIPEDA by federal order-in-council.
  When designated, the provincial law applies instead of PIPEDA for
  intra-provincial commercial activities.
  - Three provinces have substantially similar private sector laws: Alberta, BC,
    Quebec
  - PIPEDA still applies to federally regulated organizations and
    interprovincial/international commercial activities
  - Designation is formal legal process, not automatic

- **Alberta Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA)**: Enacted 2004, deemed
  substantially similar to PIPEDA. Governs collection, use, and disclosure of
  personal information by private sector organizations in Alberta.
  - Applies to provincially regulated organizations for intra-provincial
    activities
  - Contains 8 principles similar to PIPEDA's 10
  - Mandatory breach notification to Commissioner and affected individuals
  - Commissioner can order compliance and impose administrative penalties
  - Employee information covered (unlike some jurisdictions)
  - Includes provisions for automated decision-making transparency

- **BC Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA)**: Enacted 2004, deemed
  substantially similar to PIPEDA. Governs private sector privacy in British
  Columbia.
  - Similar structure to Alberta PIPA
  - Mandatory breach notification requirements
  - Commissioner can make binding orders
  - Employee information is covered
  - Includes provisions requiring explanation of automated decisions that
    significantly affect individuals
  - Whistleblower protection provisions

- **Quebec Law 25 (Act Respecting the Protection of Personal Information in the
  Private Sector, as amended)**: Quebec's private sector law was substantially
  amended by Bill 64 (2021), with provisions phasing in through 2024. Known as
  "Law 25" or "Quebec Private Sector Act."
  - Original law dates to 1994; major amendments effective 2022-2024
  - Strongest provincial private sector privacy law in Canada
  - Explicit requirements for privacy impact assessments (PIAs)
  - Mandatory privacy officer designation
  - Strict transborder transfer requirements with adequacy assessment
  - Broader individual rights including portability and erasure
  - Significant administrative monetary penalties (up to $25M or 4% of worldwide
    turnover)
  - Profiling and automated decision-making provisions with opt-out rights
  - Biometric information specific protections
  - Explicit consent required for disclosure to third parties

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Alberta business processes customer data | Apply Alberta PIPA for intra-provincial activities | Substantially similar law applies instead of PIPEDA |
| BC company has breach affecting customers | Notify BC Commissioner and affected individuals per BC PIPA | Provincial breach notification requirements apply |
| Quebec business uses automated profiling | Provide transparency about profiling; offer opt-out mechanism | Law 25 requires disclosure and withdrawal rights for profiling |
| Alberta organization transfers data to processor in Ontario | PIPEDA applies to interprovincial transfer | Provincial law only covers intra-provincial activities |
| Quebec business transferring data abroad | Conduct PIA; assess adequacy of receiving jurisdiction; document safeguards | Law 25 has explicit transborder assessment requirements |
| Federally regulated bank in BC | Apply PIPEDA, not BC PIPA | Federal industries remain under PIPEDA regardless of province |
| Quebec business collecting biometric data | Obtain express consent; inform of purposes; provide destruction timeline | Law 25 has specific biometric requirements |

## Gotchas

- **Provincial laws only apply intra-provincially**: If data crosses provincial
  or national borders in the commercial activity, PIPEDA applies. A BC company
  selling to Alberta customers is subject to PIPEDA for that transaction.

- **Federally regulated industries remain under PIPEDA**: Banks, airlines,
  telecommunications, and other federally regulated businesses are subject to
  PIPEDA even for activities within a province with substantially similar law.

- **Quebec Law 25 is significantly stricter than PIPEDA**: Organizations
  operating in Quebec face higher compliance burdens including mandatory PIAs,
  stricter consent requirements, and substantial penalties.

- **Provincial breach notification differs**: Each province has its own breach
  notification thresholds and requirements. Know the specific triggers for each
  jurisdiction.

- **Employee information treatment varies**: All three provincial laws cover
  employee personal information, but specific rules differ. Quebec has explicit
  employee monitoring provisions.

- **Automated decision-making provisions**: BC and Quebec both have transparency
  requirements for automated decisions. Quebec Law 25 provides opt-out rights
  from automated decisions.

- **Substantially similar does not mean identical**: Each provincial law has
  unique provisions. Compliance with PIPEDA does not guarantee compliance with
  provincial laws.

- **Quebec penalties are GDPR-scale**: Law 25 introduced administrative monetary
  penalties up to $25M or 4% of worldwide turnover, significantly higher than
  other Canadian jurisdictions.

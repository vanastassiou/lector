# 2.4: Understand what is and is not a commercial activity

Source: IAPP CIPP/C Body of Knowledge

## Key concepts

- **Commercial activity under PIPEDA**: PIPEDA applies to the collection, use,
  or disclosure of personal information in the course of commercial activities.
  Section 2(1) defines commercial activity as "any particular transaction, act
  or conduct or any regular course of conduct that is of a commercial character,
  including the selling, bartering or leasing of donor, membership or other
  fundraising lists."
  - Must involve a commercial character or commercial purpose
  - Includes regular business operations and one-time commercial transactions
  - Selling or leasing lists is explicitly commercial even for non-profits
  - Exchange of value (monetary or otherwise) indicates commercial character

- **Activities that are commercial**: Activities where PIPEDA applies because
  of their commercial character.
  - Sale of goods and services to consumers or businesses
  - Customer relationship management and marketing activities
  - Employee information in federally regulated organizations
  - Leasing or selling donor or membership lists
  - B2B transactions and commercial partnerships
  - E-commerce and online retail operations
  - Financial services and banking transactions
  - Commercial data processing and analytics services

- **Activities that are not commercial**: Certain activities fall outside
  PIPEDA's commercial activity scope entirely.
  - Personal or domestic purposes (individual acting in personal capacity)
  - Journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes
  - Federal government institutions (covered by Privacy Act)
  - Provincial government institutions (covered by provincial FOIPPAs)
  - Not-for-profit activities that lack commercial character
  - Political party activities (membership, donations, advocacy)
  - Employment relationships in provincially regulated organizations (in most
    provinces without substantially similar laws)

- **Non-profit organizations and commercial activity**: Non-profits present
  complex determinations. Their status as non-profit does not automatically
  exempt them from PIPEDA.
  - Commercial activities of non-profits are covered (selling goods, paid
    services, list rentals)
  - Non-commercial activities are not covered (volunteer coordination, member
    communications for non-commercial purposes)
  - Fundraising may or may not be commercial depending on the specific activity
  - Selling or leasing donor lists is explicitly commercial under the definition

- **Employee information exception**: PIPEDA's application to employee personal
  information depends on the employer's regulatory status, not the nature of the
  employment relationship.
  - Federally regulated employers: PIPEDA applies to employee information
  - Provincially regulated employers in provinces without substantially similar
    laws: PIPEDA generally does not apply to employee information (regulatory
    gap)
  - Provincially regulated employers in BC, Alberta, Quebec: Provincial law
    applies to employee information

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Commercial activity? | Why |
| -------- | -------------------- | --- |
| Retail store collecting customer purchase data | Yes | Direct sale of goods to consumers |
| Charity selling t-shirts to raise funds | Yes | Sale of merchandise is commercial |
| Non-profit renting its donor list | Yes | Explicitly included in statutory definition |
| Individual selling personal items online | No | Personal/domestic purpose exception |
| Journalist researching a story | No | Journalistic purpose exception |
| Political party collecting member data | No | Not of a commercial character |
| Hospital providing patient care | No | Not commercial; health legislation applies |
| Private clinic charging for services | Yes | Commercial provision of health services |
| Professional association providing paid courses | Yes | Sale of services is commercial |
| Volunteer coordinator managing volunteer data | No | Volunteer management lacks commercial character |
| Bank processing customer transactions | Yes | Financial services are commercial |
| University admissions office | No | Educational institution; provincial public sector law applies |
| Private tutoring company | Yes | Commercial provision of educational services |

## Gotchas

- **Non-profit does not mean non-commercial**: An organization's non-profit
  status is irrelevant to PIPEDA application. The test is whether the specific
  activity has a commercial character. A registered charity selling goods or
  renting lists engages in commercial activity subject to PIPEDA.

- **Mixed activities require separate analysis**: An organization may conduct
  both commercial and non-commercial activities. PIPEDA applies only to the
  commercial activities. A charity's fundraising dinner ticket sales are
  commercial; its volunteer appreciation event is not.

- **Personal purpose exception is narrow**: The personal or domestic purpose
  exception applies only to individuals acting in their personal capacity.
  Operating a side business from home is still commercial. The test is the
  nature of the activity, not the location.

- **Journalistic purpose has limits**: The exception protects journalistic,
  artistic, and literary purposes. It does not extend to an organization's
  marketing materials or corporate communications merely because they contain
  creative content.

- **Free services can be commercial**: The absence of direct monetary payment
  does not mean an activity is non-commercial. Services funded by advertising
  revenue or data monetization have a commercial character. The exchange of
  personal information for free services is itself commercial.

- **Employment relationship complexity**: In provinces without substantially
  similar private-sector laws (other than BC, Alberta, Quebec), PIPEDA does not
  generally cover employee personal information for provincially regulated
  employers. This creates a regulatory gap, not an indication that employment
  is non-commercial.

- **Government contractors**: Private organizations providing services under
  government contract remain subject to PIPEDA for their commercial activities,
  even though the government client would be subject to the Privacy Act.

- **Professional services are commercial**: Lawyers, accountants, and other
  professionals providing services for fees engage in commercial activities.
  Professional regulatory requirements do not displace PIPEDA obligations.

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Statutory definition source | PIPEDA s. 2(1) | "Commercial activity" is defined in the Act |
| Explicit inclusion | Selling/leasing donor, membership, fundraising lists | Removes ambiguity for non-profit list activities |
| Personal purpose exception | Yes | Individuals acting for personal/domestic purposes |
| Journalistic/artistic/literary exception | Yes | Protects specified expressive purposes |
| Government institution exception | Yes | Federal: Privacy Act; Provincial: FOIPPAs |
| Employee information in federal sector | Covered | Always under PIPEDA for federally regulated employers |
| Employee information in provincial sector | Varies | Provincial law in BC, AB, QC; gap elsewhere |

## Related topics

- **Substantially similar legislation**: Provincial laws (BC, Alberta, Quebec)
  that apply instead of PIPEDA for intra-provincial commercial activities
- **Federally regulated industries**: Sectors always under federal jurisdiction
  regardless of provincial laws (banking, telecom, transportation, broadcasting)
- **Purpose limitation**: Identifying purposes for collection is required once
  commercial activity is established
- **Consent requirements**: Once PIPEDA applies, consent obligations follow for
  collection, use, and disclosure
- **Privacy Act**: Federal public sector privacy law that applies instead of
  PIPEDA for government institutions
- **Health sector privacy laws**: Provincial health legislation that applies to
  health information regardless of commercial character

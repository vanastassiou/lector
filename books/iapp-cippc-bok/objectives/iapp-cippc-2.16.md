# 2.16: Know transborder data flow regulations and requirements

Source: IAPP CIPP/C Body of Knowledge

## Key concepts

- **Transborder data flow**: The transfer of personal information from Canada to
  another country for processing, storage, or access. PIPEDA does not prohibit
  cross-border transfers but requires organizations to maintain accountability.
  - No adequacy requirement under PIPEDA (unlike GDPR)
  - Accountability principle applies regardless of where data is transferred
  - Organizations must use contractual and other means to provide comparable
    protection
  - Both the transfer itself and the foreign processing must comply

- **Accountability for third-party transfers**: Under PIPEDA Principle 1, an
  organization remains responsible for personal information transferred to a
  third party for processing, including foreign processors.
  - Written contracts must specify permitted uses and disclosures
  - Comparable level of protection must be ensured
  - Organization cannot delegate away its accountability
  - Due diligence required before transferring

- **Transparency requirements**: Organizations must be open about their
  transborder data practices. The OPC expects organizations to inform
  individuals that their information may be transferred outside Canada.
  - Privacy policies should disclose cross-border transfers
  - Should identify countries where data may be processed
  - Should explain implications for individual rights
  - Notice at or before collection is best practice

- **Consent considerations**: Individuals should be made aware of transborder
  transfers when providing consent. The OPC has indicated that meaningful
  consent may require disclosure of foreign transfer.
  - Express consent not always required for transfers
  - Implied consent may suffice when transfer is reasonably expected
  - Must inform about transfers to fulfill openness requirement
  - Consent obtained for original purpose extends to processing in another
    jurisdiction if for same purpose

- **Foreign law access**: When personal information is transferred to another
  country, it may become subject to that country's laws, including government
  access provisions.
  - USA PATRIOT Act concerns have been prominent in Canadian context
  - CLOUD Act enables US access to data held by US companies globally
  - Organizations should assess foreign legal environment
  - Risk assessment and mitigation may be required
  - Some sectors have specific restrictions (e.g., health information)

- **Provincial variations**: Quebec's Law 25 (Private Sector Act amendments)
  introduced stricter transborder transfer requirements than PIPEDA.
  - Quebec requires privacy impact assessment before transfer
  - Must determine receiving jurisdiction provides adequate protection
  - If inadequate, must use contractual or other safeguards
  - More prescriptive framework than PIPEDA's accountability approach

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Storing customer data in US cloud service | Due diligence on provider; contract requiring comparable protection; disclose in privacy policy | Accountability remains; must ensure protection continues abroad |
| Customer asks where their data is stored | Provide information about countries where data is transferred | Openness principle requires transparency about data locations |
| Provincial health data to foreign processor | Check provincial health privacy laws; may prohibit or restrict | Health information often has stricter cross-border requirements |
| Quebec organization using foreign service | Conduct PIA; assess adequacy of foreign jurisdiction; document safeguards | Law 25 has explicit transborder assessment requirements |
| Foreign government requests data held abroad | Organization must understand and disclose this possibility; no PIPEDA exemption | Foreign law applies where data is located; transparency required |
| Call center in another country | Contract for comparable protection; train on Canadian requirements; audit compliance | Processing is still for the Canadian organization; accountability persists |

## Gotchas

- **PIPEDA does not require adequacy determination**: Unlike GDPR, PIPEDA does
  not prohibit transfers to countries lacking adequate protection. The
  organization must ensure protection through contractual means, not rely on
  government adequacy findings.

- **Disclosure in privacy policy is not enough**: Organizations must actively
  ensure comparable protection, not merely inform individuals about the
  transfer. Transparency is necessary but not sufficient.

- **Foreign law access is a real risk**: The OPC has recognized that data
  transferred to other countries becomes subject to those countries' laws. This
  is a factor organizations should consider and may need to disclose.

- **Provincial laws may be stricter**: Quebec's Law 25 imposes explicit
  assessment requirements for transborder transfers. Organizations subject to
  Quebec law must conduct PIAs and document adequacy analysis.

- **Sector-specific restrictions exist**: Some provincial health privacy laws
  restrict or prohibit cross-border transfers of health information. Always
  check sector-specific legislation.

- **Cloud does not eliminate responsibility**: Using a cloud provider in another
  country does not transfer accountability. The organization remains responsible
  regardless of where or how data is stored.

- **Subcontractors extend the chain**: If a foreign processor uses further
  subcontractors, the original organization must ensure protection extends
  through the entire chain.

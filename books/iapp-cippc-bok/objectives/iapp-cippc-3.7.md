# 3.7: Understand the individual's right of correction to their personal information

Source: IAPP CIPP/C Body of Knowledge

## Key concepts

- **Right of correction under the Privacy Act (section 12(2))**: Individuals who
  have been granted access to their personal information may request correction
  of errors or omissions
  - Right is derivative of the access right; must first obtain access to
    identify inaccuracies
  - Applies to personal information held by federal government institutions
  - Purpose is to ensure government records about individuals are accurate and
    complete
  - Supports the accuracy principle in fair information practices

- **Scope of correction requests**: Corrections may address factual errors or
  incomplete information
  - Errors of fact: incorrect dates, misspelled names, wrong addresses
  - Omissions: missing information that provides necessary context
  - Does not extend to opinions, assessments, or subjective judgments
  - Government is not required to change professional opinions or evaluations
    simply because the individual disagrees

- **Annotation when correction is refused**: If a government institution refuses
  to make a requested correction, the individual may require a notation be
  attached to the information
  - Notation records that a correction was requested and refused
  - Notation must be included whenever the information is subsequently used or
    disclosed
  - Ensures third parties are aware the individual disputes the accuracy
  - Preserves the individual's perspective in the record

- **Response timeline - 30 days**: Same timeline as access requests under
  section 14
  - Institution must respond within 30 calendar days of receiving the
    correction request
  - Extensions may apply in limited circumstances
  - Requester must be notified if an extension is taken

- **Notification of third parties**: When a correction is made, the institution
  must notify third parties to whom the information was disclosed within the
  previous year
  - Ensures corrected information propagates to other users
  - Applies where disclosure occurred within the year prior to correction
  - Third parties should update their own records accordingly

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Individual discovers their date of birth is incorrect in government records | Accept correction request; update the record; notify third parties who received the information | Factual error must be corrected under section 12(2) |
| Individual disagrees with a performance evaluation in their personnel file | Refuse correction; offer annotation of dispute | Opinions and professional assessments are not subject to correction |
| Institution refuses correction and individual disputes the refusal | Attach notation to the record; include notation in future uses/disclosures | Annotation preserves individual's position when correction is refused |
| Correction is made to information previously shared with another department | Notify the other department of the correction | Third-party notification required for disclosures within prior year |
| Individual requests correction but has not yet obtained access | Advise individual to first submit access request | Correction right is derivative of access right; must first see the information |
| Correction request concerns information disclosed two years ago | Make the correction but no third-party notification required | Notification obligation only covers disclosures within prior year |

## Gotchas

- **Correction right requires prior access**: An individual cannot request
  correction of information they have not seen. The correction right under
  section 12(2) is triggered after access has been provided. Exam questions may
  test whether candidates understand this sequencing.

- **Opinions are not correctable**: The right of correction applies to factual
  errors and omissions, not to opinions, assessments, or evaluations. An
  individual who disagrees with a supervisor's performance review cannot demand
  the opinion be changed--only that an annotation be attached.

- **Annotation is not deletion**: When correction is refused, the individual's
  recourse is annotation, not removal of the disputed information. The original
  information remains, but with a notation indicating the individual's dispute.

- **30-day timeline applies to correction requests**: The same 30-day response
  period that applies to access requests also applies to correction requests.
  This is often tested in exam questions comparing different timelines.

- **Third-party notification has a one-year lookback**: The obligation to notify
  third parties applies only to disclosures made within the year prior to the
  correction. Disclosures older than one year do not trigger this notification
  requirement.

- **Provincial FOIPPAs may differ**: Provincial freedom of information and
  protection of privacy acts may have different correction procedures,
  timelines, or annotation requirements. Exam questions may distinguish federal
  from provincial regimes.

- **Correction includes addition of missing information**: The right covers
  omissions, not just errors. If relevant information is missing and its absence
  creates an inaccurate impression, the individual may request it be added.

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Response deadline | 30 calendar days | Same as access request timeline |
| Prior access | Required | Must have obtained access before requesting correction |
| Correctable content | Facts and omissions | Opinions and assessments excluded |
| Remedy when refused | Annotation | Notation attached to disputed information |
| Annotation inclusion | All subsequent uses/disclosures | Notation must accompany information |
| Third-party notification | Required | For disclosures within prior year |
| Notification lookback | 1 year | Disclosures older than one year not covered |
| Oversight | Privacy Commissioner | May investigate complaints about refused corrections |

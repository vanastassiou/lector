# 2.11: Maintain openness in policies concerning personal information collection

Source: IAPP CIPP/C Body of Knowledge

## Key concepts

- **Openness Principle (Principle 8)**: PIPEDA Schedule 1 requires organizations to
  make information about their privacy policies and practices readily available to
  individuals. This principle ensures transparency in how personal information is
  handled.
  - Policies must be understandable by the average person
  - Information must be accessible without unreasonable effort
  - Cannot use legal jargon or technical language that obscures meaning
  - Applies to all stages of the information lifecycle

- **Required disclosure elements**: Organizations must make the following
  information available to individuals:
  - Identity and contact information of the person accountable for privacy
    compliance (typically the Privacy Officer or Chief Privacy Officer)
  - How to access personal information held by the organization
  - How to challenge compliance with privacy principles
  - Types of personal information collected and purposes for collection
  - Description of how personal information is used
  - Parties to whom personal information may be disclosed

- **Point of collection requirements**: Privacy information must be available at
  the time personal information is collected, not just afterward.
  - Notice must precede or accompany collection
  - Must inform individuals of purposes before or at time of collection
  - Collection forms should include privacy notices or links to full policies
  - Verbal collection (call centers) requires scripted privacy statements

- **Accessibility standards**: Policies must be "readily available," which means:
  - Posted prominently on websites (typically footer link to privacy policy)
  - Available in physical locations where information is collected
  - Provided upon request without charge
  - Available in formats accessible to persons with disabilities when required
  - Translated into appropriate languages for the customer base served

- **Plain language requirement**: The openness principle requires policies to be
  understandable, not merely available.
  - Avoid legal jargon and technical terms
  - Use clear, simple sentences
  - Organize information logically with headings
  - Layered notices (short summary with link to full policy) are acceptable
  - Privacy Commissioner guidance emphasizes readability

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Launching new website | Post privacy policy with prominent link | Openness requires readily available policies |
| Customer asks who handles complaints | Provide name/contact of privacy officer | Must identify accountable individual |
| Using complex legal terms in policy | Rewrite in plain language | Policies must be understandable |
| Collecting data at trade show | Provide privacy notice at booth | Point of collection disclosure required |
| Policy buried in terms of service | Create standalone privacy policy link | Must be readily accessible, not hidden |
| Customer cannot find privacy info | Review and improve accessibility | Failure of openness obligation |
| Updating privacy practices | Update policy and notify customers | Ongoing openness obligation |

## Gotchas

- **"Readily available" is active, not passive**: Organizations cannot satisfy
  openness by having a policy exist somewhere - it must be easy to find. A policy
  buried in fine print or requiring multiple clicks fails the standard.

- **Layered notices are acceptable**: A short summary with a link to the full
  policy satisfies openness requirements. You do not need to present the entire
  policy at every collection point.

- **Openness is not consent**: Making a policy available does not equal obtaining
  consent. Openness informs; consent authorizes. Both are required but serve
  different functions.

- **Updates require communication**: When policies change, organizations should
  notify individuals of material changes. Posting a new policy without notification
  may not satisfy openness for existing customers.

- **Internal policies count**: Openness applies to policies about information
  handling, not just public-facing privacy statements. Employees and third-party
  processors should understand the organization's privacy practices.

- **Policies must be current**: Outdated policies that do not reflect actual
  practices violate openness. Regular policy reviews are necessary.

- **Provincial variations**: Quebec Law 25 has additional transparency requirements
  including publishing specific information about automated decision-making and
  biometric data. BC and Alberta PIPA also require transparency but with slightly
  different formulations.

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Principle number in PIPEDA | 8 (Openness) | Schedule 1, Principle 4.8 |
| Policy must identify | Accountable person | Name or title and contact information |
| Format requirement | Readily available | Generally understood as website posting |
| Language requirement | Understandable | Plain language, not legal jargon |
| Point of collection | At or before | Cannot delay disclosure until after |
| Fee for policy access | None | Must be available without charge |

- **Accountability (Principle 1)**: Openness requires identifying the accountable
  individual, linking these two principles
- **Consent (Principle 3)**: Informed consent depends on openness - individuals
  cannot consent meaningfully without understanding practices
- **Individual Access (Principle 9)**: Openness requires explaining how individuals
  can exercise access rights
- **Challenging Compliance (Principle 10)**: Openness requires explaining complaint
  procedures
- **Privacy Impact Assessments**: PIAs often identify openness gaps in new programs
- **Quebec Law 25**: Enhanced transparency requirements including AI and biometric
  disclosures
- **OPC Guidance**: Privacy Commissioner has issued guidance on effective privacy
  policies and plain language requirements

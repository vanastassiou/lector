# 1.5: Identify differences between privacy and data protection frameworks

Source: IAPP CIPP/C Body of Knowledge

## Key concepts

- **Privacy vs. data protection**: Privacy is a broad concept encompassing an
  individual's right to control information about themselves and be free from
  intrusion. Data protection is narrower, focusing on the processing of personal
  data and the rules governing its collection, use, storage and disclosure.
  - Privacy predates data protection as a legal concept
  - Data protection emerged as a response to computerized record-keeping
  - Canadian law uses both concepts but emphasizes fair information practices

- **Framework origins and evolution**:
  - **Fair Information Practices (FIPs)**: Originated in the 1973 US HEW Report;
    established core principles for handling personal information in automated
    systems
  - **OECD Guidelines (1980)**: First international framework; codified eight
    principles for privacy protection and transborder data flows
  - **CSA Model Code (1996)**: Canadian adaptation of OECD principles; 10
    principles for private sector; became Schedule 1 of PIPEDA
  - **EU Data Protection Directive (1995) / GDPR (2016/2018)**: Rights-based
    data protection framework; influenced global standards
  - **GAPP (2009)**: AICPA/CICA framework for privacy governance; 10 principles
    with measurable criteria

- **Privacy framework approach**: Emphasizes individual rights and autonomy.
  Focuses on limiting intrusions into private life and protecting against
  surveillance. Rooted in human rights and constitutional protections.
  - Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, s. 8 (search and seizure)
  - Civil Code of Quebec, arts. 35-41 (right to privacy)
  - Common law tort of intrusion upon seclusion

- **Data protection framework approach**: Emphasizes organizational obligations
  and procedural requirements. Focuses on lawful processing, purpose limitation
  and accountability. Rooted in administrative law and regulatory compliance.
  - PIPEDA and provincial equivalents
  - Privacy Act (public sector)
  - Provincial health information statutes

## Comparison of major frameworks

| Framework | Scope | Principles | Binding | Canadian relevance |
| --------- | ----- | ---------- | ------- | ------------------ |
| OECD Guidelines | International | 8 | Non-binding | Foundation for PIPEDA |
| CSA Model Code | Canadian private sector | 10 | Via PIPEDA | Schedule 1 of PIPEDA |
| PIPEDA | Federal private sector | 10 | Yes | Primary commercial law |
| GAPP | Professional governance | 10 | Voluntary | CPA Canada guidance |
| EU GDPR | European Economic Area | 7 | Yes | Adequacy considerations |

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Organization needs EU adequacy | Apply GDPR-equivalent protections | GDPR requires adequate protection for transfers |
| Privacy audit for investor due diligence | Use GAPP criteria for measurable assessment | GAPP provides auditable, objective standards |
| New data collection system design | Apply CSA/PIPEDA principles | Binding legal requirements for Canadian organizations |
| Cross-border data transfer to US | Follow PIPEDA accountability provisions | Organization remains responsible regardless of location |
| Comparing frameworks for policy development | Map principles across frameworks | Identify common requirements and gaps |

## Gotchas

- **Number of principles differs by framework**: OECD has 8; CSA/PIPEDA has 10;
  GAPP has 10 (with 77 criteria). Exam questions may test whether you know which
  count applies to which framework.

- **Same principle, different emphasis**: "Accountability" appears in multiple
  frameworks but with different positioning. OECD places it eighth; CSA/PIPEDA
  places it first. The Canadian approach emphasizes accountability as
  foundational rather than supplementary.

- **Binding vs. non-binding confusion**: OECD Guidelines are recommendations.
  CSA Model Code was voluntary until incorporated into PIPEDA. GAPP is voluntary.
  PIPEDA is binding law. Know which framework has legal force in Canada.

- **Privacy rights vs. data protection obligations**: Privacy-focused frameworks
  (Charter, Quebec Civil Code) emphasize what individuals can claim. Data
  protection frameworks (PIPEDA) emphasize what organizations must do. An exam
  scenario might ask which framework applies to a given situation.

- **EU GDPR and Canadian law**: GDPR does not apply directly in Canada but
  affects organizations that handle EU residents' data. Canada has an adequacy
  finding under GDPR for PIPEDA-covered commercial activities, but not for
  public sector or health sector transfers.

- **GAPP is not the same as CSA/PIPEDA**: GAPP was developed by
  AICPA/CICA for privacy governance and attestation. It has 10 principles with
  77 measurable criteria. Do not confuse it with the 10 PIPEDA principles even
  though both frameworks have the same count.

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| OECD Guidelines principles | 8 | Foundational international framework |
| CSA Model Code principles | 10 | Canadian adaptation |
| PIPEDA principles | 10 | Same as CSA via Schedule 1 |
| GAPP principles | 10 | With 77 measurable criteria |
| GDPR articles | 99 | Most comprehensive data protection law |
| Canadian Charter privacy section | Section 8 | Search and seizure |
| Canada GDPR adequacy status | Partial | Commercial activities only |

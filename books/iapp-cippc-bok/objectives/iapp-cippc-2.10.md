# 2.10: Adhere to rules for collection, use, disclosure, retention, and deletion

Source: IAPP CIPP/C Body of Knowledge

## Key concepts

- **Limiting collection (Principle 4)**: Organizations shall limit collection of
  personal information to what is necessary for identified purposes.
  - Collection must be limited to what is required for the stated purposes
  - Cannot collect information "just in case" it might be useful later
  - Must use fair and lawful means of collection
  - Shall not collect by deception or misleading individuals

- **Limiting use, disclosure, and retention (Principle 5)**: Personal information
  shall not be used or disclosed for purposes other than those for which it was
  collected, except with consent or as required by law.
  - Use and disclosure limited to original stated purposes
  - New purposes require new consent before proceeding
  - Retention only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose
  - Must establish retention schedules and deletion procedures

- **Consent exceptions**: PIPEDA permits collection, use, or disclosure without
  consent in specific circumstances.
  - Required by law (subpoena, court order, statutory obligation)
  - Emergency threatening life, health, or security
  - Debt collection activities
  - Journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes
  - Publicly available information as defined in regulations
  - Fraud investigation or prevention

- **Purpose limitation doctrine**: The stated purposes at collection define the
  boundaries of permissible use.
  - Purposes must be identified before or at time of collection
  - Cannot retroactively expand purposes without new consent
  - Reasonable person standard: would individual expect this use?
  - Related purposes may be permitted if reasonably expected

- **Retention requirements**: Organizations must establish schedules for how long
  personal information is kept.
  - Retain only as long as necessary for identified purposes
  - Consider legal requirements (tax records, employment records)
  - Document retention periods in policies
  - Destroy or anonymize when no longer needed

- **Deletion and destruction**: Personal information must be disposed of securely
  when retention period ends.
  - Secure destruction to prevent unauthorized access
  - Physical records: shredding, incineration
  - Electronic records: secure erasure, degaussing, destruction
  - Extends to copies held by third parties

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Customer provides email for purchase receipt | Use only for receipt delivery; do not add to marketing list without consent | Use must align with purpose stated at collection |
| Marketing wants to use transaction data for profiling | Obtain new consent before using data for analytics not disclosed at collection | New purpose requires new consent |
| Legal hold issued during litigation | Suspend normal deletion; retain relevant records until hold lifted | Legal requirements override standard retention |
| Individual asks why information is still held | Must be able to explain retention based on legitimate ongoing purpose | Retention requires ongoing justification |
| Employee leaves the organization | Retain employment records per legal requirements; delete discretionary data | Balance legal retention with minimization |
| Third party requests customer list for marketing | Refuse unless customers consented to disclosure for that purpose | Disclosure limited to original purposes |
| Old backup tapes contain personal information | Include in destruction schedule; securely destroy when retention period ends | Deletion obligations extend to all copies |

## Gotchas

- **Collection creep**: Organizations often expand data collection over time
  without reassessing necessity. Each new field requires justification tied to
  a specific, identified purpose.

- **Implied consent has limits**: While implied consent may permit certain uses,
  it does not authorize uses a reasonable person would not expect. Sensitive
  information or unexpected uses require express consent.

- **Retention is not indefinite**: "We might need it someday" is not a valid
  retention justification. Keeping information beyond its useful life increases
  risk and violates the limiting principle.

- **Exceptions are narrow**: Consent exceptions exist for specific situations.
  Organizations cannot broadly invoke exceptions to avoid obtaining proper
  consent. Each exception has defined criteria.

- **Related purposes are limited**: While PIPEDA allows use for purposes a
  reasonable person would consider appropriate, this is not a blanket
  authorization. The connection must be logical and expected.

- **Deletion must be verifiable**: Simply marking records for deletion is
  insufficient. Organizations must confirm information is actually destroyed
  across all systems, backups, and third-party processors.

- **Third parties inherit restrictions**: When sharing information with third
  parties, the original purpose limitations follow. Third parties cannot use
  data for their own purposes without separate consent.

- **Legal holds override schedules**: When litigation is anticipated or
  underway, normal deletion must stop. Destroying evidence after a legal hold
  creates serious liability.

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| PIPEDA principle for limiting collection | Principle 4 | Schedule 1, Section 4.4 |
| PIPEDA principle for limiting use/disclosure/retention | Principle 5 | Schedule 1, Section 4.5 |
| Default position on consent | Required | Exceptions must be specifically justified |
| Maximum retention period | Not specified | As long as necessary for purpose |
| Retention schedule required | Yes (implied) | Must have documented retention periods |
| Secure destruction required | Yes | Prevent unauthorized access to disposed data |
| Third-party deletion required | Yes | Must ensure processors also delete |

## Related topics

- **Identifying purposes (Principle 2)**: Purposes must be identified before
  collection; collection rules depend on clear purpose statements
- **Consent (Principle 3)**: Consent scope defines permissible uses; new uses
  require new consent
- **Accuracy (Principle 6)**: Information kept for ongoing use must remain
  accurate for the purpose
- **Safeguards (Principle 7)**: Protection requirements continue until secure
  destruction occurs
- **Openness (Principle 8)**: Policies should explain retention practices and
  purpose limitations
- **Third-party accountability**: Retention and deletion obligations extend to
  processors handling information on behalf of the organization
- **Breach notification**: Retaining unnecessary data increases breach impact;
  minimization reduces risk exposure

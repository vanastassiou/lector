# 4.5: Apply collection, use, and disclosure rules for PHI

Source: IAPP CIPP/C Body of Knowledge (Version 3.1.0, Effective 1 Sept. 2025)

## Key concepts

- **Necessity principle**: Provincial health privacy laws limit collection, use, and
  disclosure of PHI to what is reasonably necessary for the purpose. Custodians
  must not collect more PHI than required, use it for unrelated purposes, or
  disclose it beyond what the purpose demands.

- **Collection rules**: PHI may only be collected:
  - Directly from the individual, unless an exception applies
  - For a purpose that is lawful and relates to the custodian's functions
  - In an amount no greater than necessary for the identified purpose
  - With appropriate consent or under a statutory exception

- **Use rules**: Once collected, PHI may only be used:
  - For the purpose for which it was collected
  - For a purpose the individual would reasonably expect
  - With consent for a new purpose
  - Under a statutory exception (e.g., preventing serious harm, legal
    proceedings, health system management)

- **Disclosure rules**: Disclosure of PHI to third parties requires:
  - Express consent from the individual, or
  - Implied consent within the circle of care for treatment purposes, or
  - A statutory exception permitting disclosure without consent

- **Statutory disclosure exceptions**: Provincial health acts permit disclosure
  without consent for:
  - Mandatory public health reporting (communicable diseases, child abuse)
  - Court orders and subpoenas
  - Preventing or reducing serious risk of harm to the individual or others
  - Health system planning, research with ethics board approval
  - Proceedings before a tribunal or regulatory body
  - Disclosure to a successor custodian (e.g., practice sale)

- **Limiting disclosure**: When disclosure is permitted, custodians must disclose
  only the minimum PHI necessary. This includes:
  - De-identifying information where feasible
  - Providing only the specific records relevant to the request
  - Using aggregate data rather than individual records for planning or research

- **Third-party processors**: When PHI is transferred to a third party for
  processing (e.g., transcription services, cloud storage), the custodian remains
  accountable. Requirements include:
  - Written agreement specifying permitted uses
  - Security and confidentiality obligations
  - Restrictions on further disclosure
  - Return or destruction of PHI upon contract termination

- **Retention requirements**: PHI must be retained for the period required by law
  or professional standards. Common requirements include:
  - Hospital records: typically 10 years from last entry
  - Physician records: typically 10 years after last visit, or 10 years after
    patient reaches age of majority
  - After retention period expires, PHI must be securely destroyed

- **Destruction standards**: When PHI is no longer required, it must be destroyed
  in a manner that prevents reconstruction:
  - Paper records: cross-cut shredding or incineration
  - Electronic records: secure deletion, degaussing, or physical destruction
  - Third-party destruction: obtain certificate of destruction

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Physician collects full medical history for annual checkup | Permitted; collection is necessary for care | Direct collection for treatment purpose |
| Hospital discloses patient records to insurer | Requires express consent | Insurer is outside circle of care |
| Lab sends test results to referring physician | Implied consent applies | Physician is within circle of care |
| Public health authority requests HIV test results | Disclosure required by law | Mandatory disease reporting exception |
| Researcher requests identifiable patient data | Requires consent or REB-approved waiver | Research is not treatment |
| Hospital provides aggregate data for health planning | Permitted without consent | Disclosure for health system management |
| Clinic outsources billing to third-party processor | Written agreement required | Custodian remains accountable |
| Police request patient records without warrant | Cannot disclose without consent or court order | Law enforcement request does not override confidentiality |
| Physician retires and sells practice | Disclosure to successor permitted | Successor custodian exception |
| Retention period for patient record expires | Securely destroy the record | Must prevent reconstruction of PHI |

## Gotchas

- **Collection must be direct unless exception applies.** Collecting PHI from
  family members, employers, or other third parties is only permitted when the
  individual is incapable, collection from the individual would compromise safety,
  or another exception applies.

- **Purpose limitation applies to use, not just collection.** Even if PHI was
  lawfully collected, using it for a different purpose requires new consent or a
  statutory exception. Marketing is rarely a permitted secondary use.

- **Disclosure to law enforcement is not automatic.** Police requests without a
  warrant or court order do not require disclosure. The "serious harm" exception
  requires imminent risk, not merely ongoing investigation.

- **Research requires specific authorization.** General consent to treatment does
  not authorize research use. Researchers need either individual consent or a
  research ethics board waiver based on impracticability and minimal risk.

- **Third-party agreements are mandatory, not optional.** Transferring PHI to
  processors without a written agreement violates accountability requirements.
  Verbal assurances are insufficient.

- **Minimum necessary applies to all disclosures.** Even when disclosure is
  authorized, the custodian must limit disclosure to what is needed for the
  specific purpose. Providing entire records when excerpts would suffice violates
  this principle.

- **Retention minimums, not maximums.** The retention period specifies the
  minimum time records must be kept. Custodians may retain longer if there is a
  legitimate purpose, but must eventually destroy records.

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Collection source | Direct from individual | Indirect collection requires exception |
| Collection amount | Minimum necessary | Only what is needed for purpose |
| Use scope | Original purpose | New purposes require new consent |
| Disclosure default | Consent required | Unless statutory exception applies |
| Circle of care disclosure | Implied consent | For treatment purposes only |
| Third-party transfers | Written agreement required | Custodian remains accountable |
| Retention period | 10 years typical | Varies by record type and province |
| Destruction method | Must prevent reconstruction | Shredding, secure deletion, or incineration |

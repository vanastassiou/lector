# 2.12: Respond to individuals seeking access to personal information

Source: IAPP CIPP/C Body of Knowledge

## Key concepts

- **Individual Access Principle (Principle 9)**: PIPEDA Schedule 1 establishes that
  individuals have the right to access personal information held about them by an
  organization. This includes being informed of the existence, use, and disclosure
  of their personal information, and being given access to that information upon
  request.
  - The right is not absolute; specific exemptions apply
  - Applies to personal information in any form (electronic, paper, recordings)
  - Includes the right to challenge accuracy and completeness

- **Identity verification**: Organizations must verify the identity of individuals
  making access requests before disclosing personal information.
  - Verification methods must be reasonable and proportionate
  - Cannot require verification beyond what is necessary
  - Common methods include government-issued ID, security questions, or account
    credentials
  - Must balance security against accessibility of the right
  - Over-verification can itself be a barrier to access rights

- **Response timeline under PIPEDA**: Organizations must respond to access
  requests within 30 days of receiving the request.
  - The clock starts when the request is received, not acknowledged
  - Extensions are permitted in limited circumstances (e.g., meeting deadline
    would unreasonably interfere with operations, or consultation is required)
  - Must notify the requester of any extension and their right to complain to
    the Privacy Commissioner

- **Information that must be provided**: Upon a valid access request,
  organizations must disclose:
  - The personal information held about the individual
  - How that information has been used
  - Third parties to whom the information has been disclosed
  - Sufficient detail for the individual to understand and challenge accuracy

- **Manner of access**: Organizations must provide personal information in a form
  that is generally understandable.
  - Must explain abbreviations, codes, and technical terms
  - Provide access in the format requested if reasonably possible
  - May provide a copy rather than allowing direct examination
  - Fee must be minimal and not a barrier to access

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Customer requests all data held about them | Verify identity, compile records, respond within 30 days | PIPEDA Principle 9 access right |
| Unable to locate all records in 30 days | Notify requester of extension with reason | Extension permitted but must notify |
| Request includes third-party information | Redact third-party personal information before disclosure | Cannot disclose others' personal information |
| Requester cannot verify identity | Offer alternative verification methods | Must balance access against security |
| Request is vague or unclear | Seek clarification while preserving timeline | Cannot use ambiguity to delay indefinitely |
| Information contains technical codes | Provide legend or explanation with response | Must be generally understandable |
| Large volume of information requested | May charge reasonable fee for reproduction | Fee cannot be prohibitive |
| Requester disputes accuracy after access | Provide correction or annotate records | Access linked to correction rights |

## Gotchas

- **30 days is the maximum, not the standard**: Organizations should aim to
  respond faster when possible. Routinely taking the full 30 days may attract
  Commissioner scrutiny.

- **Acknowledging receipt is not responding**: Sending an acknowledgment does not
  satisfy the response obligation. The substantive response with information or a
  denial must occur within the timeline.

- **Cannot charge for access itself**: While organizations may charge a minimal
  fee for reproduction costs, they cannot charge for the act of searching for or
  compiling the information. Fees must not discourage access.

- **Partial disclosure is acceptable**: If some information is exempt, disclose
  what can be disclosed and explain what is withheld and why. Do not refuse the
  entire request because part is exempt.

- **Denials require reasons**: If access is denied in whole or in part, the
  organization must explain why and inform the individual of their right to
  complain to the Privacy Commissioner.

- **Third-party information vs. information about third parties**: Information
  about an individual's transactions with third parties (e.g., purchase history)
  is the requester's personal information. Information that would reveal another
  person's personal information must be withheld or redacted.

- **Provincial variations matter**: Quebec Law 25 requires a response within 30
  days but permits a 10-day extension. BC PIPA also uses 30 days. Alberta PIPA
  allows 45 days. Know which timeline applies.

- **Employee vs. customer access**: PIPEDA applies to employee information only
  for federally regulated employers. For provincially regulated employers, the
  applicable provincial legislation governs access rights.

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| PIPEDA response timeline | 30 days | From receipt of request |
| Privacy Act timeline | 30 days | For public sector access requests |
| Alberta PIPA timeline | 45 days | Longer than federal standard |
| Quebec Law 25 timeline | 30 days + 10 days extension | Extension available |
| BC PIPA timeline | 30 days | May extend to 60 days |
| Principle number in PIPEDA | 9 (Individual Access) | Schedule 1, Principle 4.9 |
| Fee for access | Minimal or none | Cannot be prohibitive |
| Information format | Generally understandable | Explain codes and abbreviations |
| Identity verification | Reasonable and proportionate | Not overly burdensome |

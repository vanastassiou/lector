# 4.4: Understand consent requirements specific to health sector

Source: IAPP CIPP/C Body of Knowledge (Version 3.1.0, Effective 1 Sept. 2025)

## Key concepts

- **Meaningful consent for PHI**: Health privacy legislation requires consent that
  is informed, voluntary, and specific to the purpose. The individual must
  understand what PHI is being collected, why it is needed, how it will be used,
  and to whom it may be disclosed. Consent obtained through coercion, deception,
  or without adequate information is not valid.

- **Express consent**: An explicit, affirmative indication of agreement, either
  verbal or written. Required for:
  - Disclosure of PHI outside the circle of care
  - Use of PHI for purposes unrelated to treatment (e.g., marketing, research)
  - Disclosure to third parties such as insurers, employers, or legal
    representatives
  - Secondary uses not contemplated at the time of collection

- **Implied consent**: Consent inferred from an individual's actions or the
  circumstances. In health settings, implied consent operates within the circle
  of care:
  - When an individual seeks health care, consent to collect and use PHI for
    treatment purposes is implied
  - Disclosure to other health care providers involved in the individual's care
    is permitted without express consent
  - The individual must have a reasonable expectation that their information
    will be shared for treatment purposes

- **Circle of care**: The group of health care providers who require PHI to
  provide treatment to an individual. Key characteristics:
  - Members must be directly involved in the individual's health care
  - Includes physicians, nurses, specialists, pharmacists, and other providers
    delivering or supporting the individual's treatment
  - Does not include administrative staff, researchers, or health care providers
    not involved in that individual's care
  - The individual can restrict the circle of care by withdrawing consent for
    specific providers or types of information

- **Consent withdrawal**: Individuals have the right to withdraw consent at any
  time. Upon withdrawal:
  - The custodian must cease the collection, use, or disclosure for which
    consent was withdrawn
  - Withdrawal does not apply retroactively to uses or disclosures already made
  - The custodian may continue using PHI where required by law or where a
    consent exception applies

- **Consent for minors and incapable individuals**: Provincial health acts
  specify rules for substitute consent:
  - Parents or guardians typically consent for minor children
  - Mature minors (capable of understanding) may consent for themselves
  - Substitute decision-makers consent for individuals who are incapable
  - The hierarchy of substitute decision-makers varies by province

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Patient visits physician for diagnosis | Implied consent for collection and use | Treatment context permits implied consent within circle of care |
| Physician refers patient to specialist | Implied consent for disclosure to specialist | Specialist is within circle of care |
| Hospital shares PHI with patient's employer | Express consent required | Employer is outside circle of care |
| Pharmacist fills prescription from physician | Implied consent for disclosure | Pharmacist is within circle of care for treatment |
| Researcher requests access to patient records | Express consent or research ethics approval with waiver | Research is outside treatment purposes |
| Patient requests information not be shared with family member | Custodian must respect restriction | Patients can limit disclosures within circle of care |
| Emergency treatment when patient is unconscious | Consent exception applies | Health acts permit treatment without consent in emergencies |
| Insurer requests medical records for claim | Express consent required | Insurer is outside circle of care |
| Patient refuses to consent to collection | Custodian may refuse treatment if PHI is necessary | Consent to collect is required, but can affect service |

## Gotchas

- **Implied consent only applies within the circle of care.** Disclosure to
  anyone not directly involved in the individual's health care requires express
  consent or a statutory exception. Administrative staff processing records do
  not fall within the circle of care for consent purposes.

- **Circle of care is not unlimited.** Just because a provider works in health
  care does not mean they are in every patient's circle of care. The provider
  must be directly involved in delivering or supporting that individual's
  treatment.

- **Consent to treatment is not consent to research.** A patient consenting to
  receive care is not thereby consenting to have their PHI used for research.
  Research use requires separate express consent or an approved research ethics
  board waiver.

- **Individuals can restrict implied consent.** A patient may instruct their
  physician not to share information with a specific specialist or provider.
  The custodian must respect this restriction even within the circle of care.

- **Lack of consent does not always block collection.** Provincial health acts
  contain exceptions permitting collection, use, or disclosure without consent
  for purposes such as public health reporting, mandatory disease notification,
  court orders, or preventing serious harm.

- **Substitute consent has a hierarchy.** When an individual cannot consent,
  provincial laws specify who may act as substitute decision-maker. The order
  of priority (e.g., guardian, spouse, adult child) differs by province.

- **Oral consent may be valid for express consent.** While written consent
  provides better documentation, most provincial health acts permit oral express
  consent for PHI disclosure. However, custodians should document oral consent
  in the health record.

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Implied consent scope | Circle of care only | Does not extend to disclosures outside treatment |
| Express consent form | Written or oral | Written preferred for documentation purposes |
| Consent withdrawal | Prospective only | Does not undo prior lawful uses or disclosures |
| Minor consent | Varies by province | Mature minor may consent independently |
| Research consent | Express required | Or research ethics board waiver |
| Emergency exception | Applies when patient incapable | Treatment permitted without consent in emergencies |

# 2.8: Acquire meaningful and valid consent

Source: IAPP CIPP/C Body of Knowledge

## Key concepts

- **Meaningful consent**: Consent is only valid when individuals understand what
  they are agreeing to.
  - Requires clear, plain language explanation of purposes
  - Individual must understand what personal information is collected
  - Must know how information will be used and disclosed
  - OPC emphasizes consent is not meaningful if buried in lengthy terms

- **Valid consent requirements**: PIPEDA Principle 3 establishes that knowledge
  and consent are required for collection, use, or disclosure.
  - Consent must be obtained before or at time of collection
  - Cannot be unduly vague or overly broad
  - Must be specific to identified purposes
  - Individual must have genuine ability to decline

- **Reasonableness standard**: Under PIPEDA section 5(3), consent is only valid
  if a reasonable person would consider the collection, use, or disclosure
  appropriate in the circumstances.
  - Balances organizational needs against individual privacy expectations
  - Sensitive information requires higher justification threshold
  - Context matters: what is reasonable for a bank differs from a retailer
  - OPC applies this standard when assessing consent validity

- **Forms of consent**: The appropriate form depends on sensitivity and
  reasonable expectations.
  - **Express consent**: Explicit affirmative action required for sensitive
    information, unexpected uses, or significant consequences
  - **Implied consent**: May be inferred from actions where purposes are obvious
    and information is less sensitive
  - **Opt-out consent**: Individual is notified and can decline; appropriate for
    certain less sensitive uses like marketing

- **Opt-out mechanisms**: When opt-out consent is used, organizations must
  provide accessible and effective withdrawal methods.
  - Must be simple and not require excessive effort
  - Explained at time consent is obtained
  - Must honor opt-out requests promptly
  - Cannot impose penalties for opting out
  - CASL has specific unsubscribe requirements for electronic messages

- **New purposes require fresh consent**: When an organization wants to use
  information for purposes not originally identified, new consent is required.
  - Cannot rely on original consent for expanded uses
  - Must notify individual of new purpose before use
  - Individual can refuse without affecting original consent
  - Exception: new purpose is clearly consistent with original

- **Consent as a condition of service**: Organizations cannot require consent
  beyond what is necessary to provide the product or service.
  - Cannot bundle unrelated data practices with service delivery
  - Required elements only: consent for purposes necessary to fulfill request
  - Optional elements must be separable and genuinely optional
  - Tying consent to unrelated marketing violates this principle

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Collecting SIN for employment | Express consent with explanation of purpose | SIN is highly sensitive; implied consent insufficient |
| Retailer wants to send promotional emails | Opt-out mechanism with clear notice at point of sale | Marketing is predictable use; opt-out is appropriate |
| Health app wants to share data with advertisers | Express consent with separate toggle; cannot be bundled | Sharing with third parties for advertising is unexpected |
| Bank using credit score for loan decision | Implied consent acceptable if disclosed in application | Credit assessment is expected in lending context |
| Website changing privacy policy to add new uses | Notify users and obtain fresh consent for material changes | New purposes require new consent |
| Loyalty program wants to sell data to partners | Cannot proceed; this was not an original purpose | Selling data fundamentally different from operating loyalty program |
| Free service requiring marketing consent | Must offer alternative or make marketing truly optional | Cannot tie unrelated consent to service access |
| Employee monitoring program | Express consent with detailed notice before implementation | Monitoring is intrusive; sensitivity demands express consent |

## Gotchas

- **Scroll-through consent is problematic**: Requiring individuals to scroll
  through lengthy terms before clicking "I agree" does not constitute meaningful
  consent if key terms are not highlighted or summarized.

- **Pre-checked boxes do not constitute express consent**: For express consent,
  the individual must take an affirmative action. Pre-selected options that
  require opting out are only valid where implied consent is appropriate.

- **Consent obtained through deception is void**: Misleading statements about
  purposes or uses invalidate consent entirely. Misrepresenting data practices
  to obtain consent is a PIPEDA violation.

- **Bundled consent may be invalid**: Requiring consent to multiple unrelated
  purposes as a single package undermines the ability to provide meaningful
  consent to each purpose.

- **Silence does not equal consent for sensitive uses**: While implied consent
  may be inferred from inaction in some circumstances, silence cannot establish
  consent for sensitive information or unexpected purposes.

- **Withdrawal must be easy**: If obtaining consent is simple but withdrawal
  requires excessive steps (phone calls, forms, waiting periods), the consent
  mechanism may not be valid.

- **Reasonable expectations matter**: Even with technical consent, if a
  reasonable person would not expect the use, the reasonableness standard under
  PIPEDA section 5(3) may invalidate it.

- **Third-party sharing requires specific consent**: General consent to an
  organization's practices does not extend to sharing with unnamed third
  parties for their own purposes.

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Consent timing | At or before collection | Retroactive consent problematic |
| Sensitive information | Express consent required | Health, financial, biometric, children's data |
| Marketing communications | Opt-out permitted | Must be clear and accessible |
| New purposes | Fresh consent required | Before new use begins |
| Withdrawal timeline | Without unreasonable delay | No legislated maximum, but must be prompt |
| Condition of service | Limited to necessary purposes | Cannot require consent to unrelated uses |
| Standard for validity | Reasonable person test | PIPEDA section 5(3) |

# 4.7: Know the Genetic Non-Discrimination Act and its implications

Source: IAPP CIPP/C Body of Knowledge (Version 3.1.0, Effective 1 Sept. 2025)

## Key concepts

- **Genetic Non-Discrimination Act (GNA)**: Federal legislation (S.C. 2017,
  c. 3) that prohibits requiring genetic tests or disclosure of genetic test
  results as a condition of providing goods, services, or entering into
  contracts. It amends both the Canada Labour Code and the Canadian Human
  Rights Act to include genetic characteristics as a prohibited ground of
  discrimination.

- **Genetic test**: A test that analyzes DNA, RNA, or chromosomes for purposes
  such as predicting the risk of developing disease or conditions, or assessing
  characteristics inherited from parents. Includes:
  - Direct-to-consumer genetic tests
  - Clinical genetic testing ordered by physicians
  - Pharmacogenomic testing
  - Carrier testing for heritable conditions

- **Prohibited requirements**: Under the GNA, no person shall require an
  individual to:
  - Undergo a genetic test as a condition of providing goods or services
  - Undergo a genetic test as a condition of entering into a contract
  - Disclose the results of a genetic test as a condition of providing goods or
    services
  - Disclose the results of a genetic test as a condition of entering into a
    contract
  - Collect, use, or disclose genetic test results without written consent

- **Constitutional challenge**: Quebec challenged the GNA's constitutionality,
  arguing it exceeded federal criminal law power. In *Reference re Genetic
  Non-Discrimination Act* (2020 SCC 17), the Supreme Court of Canada upheld the
  law as valid criminal law, affirming Parliament's authority to prohibit
  genetic discrimination.

- **Exceptions under the GNA**: The Act does not apply when:
  - A health care practitioner requires genetic test results to provide health
    services to the individual
  - A researcher requires genetic test results for medical or scientific
    research purposes (with consent)
  - The individual voluntarily discloses results for their own purposes

- **Canadian Human Rights Act amendments**: The GNA added "genetic
  characteristics" as a prohibited ground of discrimination in federal
  jurisdiction. Employers and service providers in federally regulated sectors
  cannot discriminate based on genetic information.

- **Canada Labour Code amendments**: Extended protections to federally regulated
  employees, prohibiting employers from requiring genetic testing or disclosure
  of genetic test results.

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Insurance company requires genetic test before issuing life insurance | Prohibited under GNA | Cannot require genetic test as condition of contract |
| Employer asks job applicant to disclose genetic test results | Prohibited under GNA and Canadian Human Rights Act | Genetic characteristics are prohibited ground of discrimination |
| Physician orders genetic test to diagnose patient condition | Permitted exception | Health care practitioners providing health services are exempt |
| Research study requests genetic samples with informed consent | Permitted exception | Medical research with consent is exempt |
| Insurer denies claim after discovering undisclosed genetic test | Prohibited | Cannot require disclosure of existing test results |
| Individual voluntarily shares genetic test with employer for accommodation | Permitted | Voluntary disclosure for individual's own benefit is allowed |
| Pharmacy refuses service unless customer provides DNA test | Prohibited | Cannot condition goods/services on genetic testing |

## Gotchas

- **Existing genetic test results are protected.** The GNA prohibits requiring
  disclosure of past genetic tests, not only requiring new tests. An insurer
  cannot ask if an individual has ever undergone genetic testing.

- **Written consent is required for collection.** Even when disclosure is
  voluntary, the collecting party must obtain written consent before collecting,
  using, or disclosing genetic test results.

- **Health sector exception is narrow.** The exception for health care
  practitioners applies only when providing health services to that specific
  individual. It does not permit research, insurance purposes, or employment
  decisions.

- **Provincial human rights codes may provide parallel protection.** While the
  GNA applies federally, some provinces have added genetic characteristics to
  their human rights legislation. Know which protections apply in each
  jurisdiction.

- **Pharmacogenomic testing is included.** Tests that determine how an
  individual will respond to medications are genetic tests under the GNA and
  receive the same protections.

- **Genetic information is also PHI.** Under provincial health privacy acts,
  genetic test results are personal health information. The GNA provides
  additional federal protections beyond provincial health privacy requirements.

- **Family history is distinct from genetic testing.** The GNA specifically
  covers genetic test results. Requiring disclosure of family medical history
  may not trigger GNA protections, though it may engage other privacy
  considerations.

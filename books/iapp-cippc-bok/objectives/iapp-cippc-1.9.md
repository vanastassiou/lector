# 1.9: Know recent legal developments and court decisions affecting privacy law

Source: IAPP CIPP/C Body of Knowledge (Version 3.1.0, Effective 1 Sept. 2025)

## Key concepts

- **Role of courts and tribunals in privacy law interpretation**: Canadian courts
  and administrative tribunals shape privacy law through judicial decisions.
  Courts interpret statutory language, resolve ambiguities, and establish
  precedents that guide future compliance. The Federal Court has jurisdiction
  over PIPEDA appeals, while provincial courts address provincial privacy
  statutes.

- **Commissioner rulings and their effect**: Privacy Commissioner findings and
  guidance, while not always legally binding, establish interpretive standards
  that organizations should follow.
  - OPC findings interpret PIPEDA provisions and set compliance expectations
  - Provincial commissioners (AB, BC, QC) issue binding orders
  - Published decisions create de facto standards for similar situations
  - Guidance documents and position statements influence organizational practices

- **Quebec Law 25 (Bill 64)**: Major modernization of Quebec's private sector
  privacy law, phased in from 2022-2024.
  - Mandatory Privacy Impact Assessments for certain processing
  - Mandatory breach notification to Commission d'accès à l'information (CAI)
  - Right to data portability
  - Enhanced consent requirements and transparency obligations
  - Expanded enforcement powers and significant administrative monetary penalties
  - Extraterritorial application to organizations processing Quebec residents' data

- **PIPEDA amendments and proposed reforms**: Ongoing legislative efforts to
  modernize federal privacy law.
  - Bill C-27 (Digital Charter Implementation Act) proposed significant changes
  - Consumer Privacy Protection Act (CPPA) as proposed PIPEDA replacement
  - Artificial Intelligence and Data Act (AIDA) as companion legislation
  - Proposed administrative monetary penalties and private right of action
  - Enhanced protections for minors and sensitive data

- **Consent and reasonable expectations doctrine**: Courts have refined what
  constitutes valid consent and reasonable individual expectations.
  - Consent must be meaningful, informed, and specific to purposes
  - "Bundled consent" and take-it-or-leave-it approaches scrutinized
  - Reasonable expectations of privacy vary by context
  - Express consent required for sensitive personal information

- **Definition of personal information**: Court and commissioner decisions
  continue to clarify the scope of "personal information."
  - Information "about an identifiable individual" broadly interpreted
  - IP addresses, device identifiers, and online activity can be personal info
  - Business contact information exceptions narrowly construed
  - Work product may or may not constitute personal information

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Organization operates in Quebec and other provinces | Comply with Law 25 for Quebec residents plus PIPEDA/other provincial laws | Law 25 applies to Quebec residents regardless of organization location |
| Commissioner issues finding on similar fact pattern | Review and align practices with Commissioner interpretation | Commissioner findings guide compliance even if not binding orders |
| New court decision interprets consent requirement | Update consent processes to reflect judicial interpretation | Courts establish binding precedent on statutory interpretation |
| Privacy Commissioner publishes new guidance | Review organizational practices against guidance | Guidance reflects current enforcement priorities and expectations |
| Proposed legislation would change compliance requirements | Monitor developments; prepare for implementation | Legislative changes require adaptation of privacy programs |
| Court finds business practice violates reasonable expectations | Discontinue practice and remediate harm | Court decisions establish what is legally permissible |

## Gotchas

- **Quebec Law 25 has extraterritorial reach.** Organizations outside Quebec that
  process Quebec residents' personal information must comply. This parallels GDPR
  extraterritoriality and can catch unprepared organizations.

- **OPC findings are persuasive but not binding.** Unlike Alberta, BC, and Quebec
  commissioners who can issue orders, the federal Privacy Commissioner makes
  recommendations. However, Federal Court can issue binding orders on PIPEDA
  matters.

- **Commissioner guidance can change interpretation.** The OPC and provincial
  commissioners regularly update guidance documents. What was acceptable
  practice may become non-compliant when guidance changes.

- **Legislative reform may significantly alter requirements.** Proposed federal
  reforms (CPPA/AIDA) would introduce administrative monetary penalties and
  other major changes. Organizations should monitor and prepare for potential
  new obligations.

- **Provincial developments affect national organizations.** Quebec's Law 25
  created new requirements that affect any organization with Quebec customers.
  Provincial legal developments can have national compliance implications.

- **Court decisions on reasonable expectations are context-dependent.** There is
  no universal standard for reasonable expectations of privacy. Courts apply
  contextual analysis, so similar facts may yield different outcomes based on
  circumstances.

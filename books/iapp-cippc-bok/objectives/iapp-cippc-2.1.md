# 2.1: Know the privacy principles that are the foundation of PIPEDA

Source: IAPP CIPP/C Body of Knowledge

## Key concepts

- **PIPEDA (Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act)**: Federal
  private-sector privacy law enacted in 2000 (fully effective 2004). Governs how
  private-sector organizations collect, use and disclose personal information in the
  course of commercial activities.
  - Schedule 1 incorporates the CSA Model Code's 10 privacy principles
  - Applies to federally regulated industries and interprovincial/international
    commercial activities
  - Provincial laws may be deemed "substantially similar" and apply instead

- **The 10 PIPEDA Principles** (CSA Model Code): These principles form Schedule 1
  of PIPEDA and are legally binding. Organizations must comply with all ten:

  1. **Accountability**: An organization is responsible for personal information
     under its control. Must designate an individual accountable for compliance.
     - Accountability continues when information is transferred to third parties
     - Must implement policies and practices to give effect to principles
     - Privacy officer designation is required

  2. **Identifying Purposes**: Purposes for collecting personal information must be
     identified at or before the time of collection.
     - Purposes must be documented
     - New purposes require fresh consent before use
     - Purposes should be specific enough to be meaningful

  3. **Consent**: Knowledge and consent are required for collection, use or
     disclosure, except where inappropriate.
     - Consent must be meaningful and informed
     - Form of consent varies based on sensitivity and reasonable expectations
     - Express consent for sensitive information; implied may suffice for less
       sensitive contexts
     - Cannot require consent beyond what is necessary for the transaction

  4. **Limiting Collection**: Collection must be limited to what is necessary for
     identified purposes. Information must be collected by fair and lawful means.
     - "Necessary" is interpreted strictly
     - Prohibits collection for speculative future uses
     - Collection methods must not be deceptive

  5. **Limiting Use, Disclosure, and Retention**: Personal information shall not be
     used or disclosed for purposes other than those for which it was collected,
     except with consent or as required by law.
     - Retention only as long as necessary for purpose
     - Must have retention schedules and destruction procedures
     - Secondary uses require new consent

  6. **Accuracy**: Personal information must be as accurate, complete and up-to-date
     as necessary for the purposes for which it is used.
     - Accuracy requirements tied to consequences of inaccuracy
     - Information used for decisions about individuals requires higher accuracy
     - Must update when individual provides new information

  7. **Safeguards**: Personal information must be protected by security safeguards
     appropriate to the sensitivity of the information.
     - Administrative, technical and physical safeguards required
     - Protection level must match sensitivity
     - Employees must be trained on security procedures
     - Information awaiting destruction must also be protected

  8. **Openness**: Organizations must make information about their policies and
     practices readily available to individuals.
     - Privacy policies must be clear and accessible
     - Must identify who is accountable for compliance
     - Cannot hide behind complex legal language

  9. **Individual Access**: Upon request, individuals must be informed of the
     existence, use and disclosure of their personal information and given access
     to it, with limited exceptions.
     - Right to challenge accuracy and have information amended
     - Response required within 30 days
     - May charge reasonable cost-recovery fees
     - Exceptions for legal privilege, commercial confidentiality, third-party
       information

  10. **Challenging Compliance**: Individuals must be able to challenge an
      organization's compliance with these principles.
      - Must have procedures to receive and respond to complaints
      - Complaints may be escalated to Privacy Commissioner
      - Must investigate all complaints

- **Commercial Activity**: PIPEDA applies to the collection, use or disclosure of
  personal information in the course of commercial activity.
  - Buying, selling, bartering, leasing goods or services
  - Membership lists and customer databases
  - Employee information in federally regulated businesses

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Customer asks what data you hold | Provide access within 30 days | Individual Access: right to know what is held |
| Third-party processor handles data | Contract with privacy requirements | Accountability: remains with original organization |
| Collecting SIN for loyalty program | Do not collect; not necessary | Limiting Collection: must be necessary for purpose |
| Customer withdraws consent | Cease processing; inform of consequences | Consent: can be withdrawn; may affect service |
| Using customer data for new marketing | Obtain new consent first | Identifying Purposes/Consent: new purpose requires consent |
| Storing data indefinitely "just in case" | Implement retention schedules | Limiting Retention: only keep as needed |
| Customer disputes information accuracy | Review and correct if warranted | Accuracy/Challenging Compliance: must address challenges |

## Gotchas

- **Consent is not always required**: PIPEDA includes exceptions where consent is
  not required (legal requirements, emergencies, journalistic purposes, etc.). Do
  not assume consent is always necessary.

- **Accountability survives outsourcing**: When you transfer data to a third party,
  you remain accountable. A contract does not transfer accountability - it manages
  risk but you are still responsible.

- **"Necessary" is strict**: Limiting Collection requires information to be
  necessary, not merely useful. "Nice to have" data should not be collected.

- **Express vs. implied consent**: Sensitive information (health, financial, SIN)
  requires express consent. Less sensitive information may allow implied consent
  based on reasonable expectations.

- **Opt-out is not always valid**: Negative consent (assuming consent unless
  individual objects) is only appropriate for non-sensitive information where
  individual can reasonably expect the use.

- **Access exceptions are narrow**: You can deny access for legal privilege,
  third-party information, or commercial confidentiality, but must explain why
  access is denied and allow the individual to challenge the denial.

- **Consent cannot be a condition of service**: You cannot require consent to
  collection beyond what is necessary to provide the service. Bundling unrelated
  data collection with service provision violates this principle.

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Number of PIPEDA principles | 10 | All derived from CSA Model Code |
| Access request response time | 30 days | May extend with notice in limited cases |
| PIPEDA enacted | 2000 | Phased implementation; fully effective 2004 |
| Schedule containing principles | Schedule 1 | CSA Model Code incorporated by reference |
| Breach notification required | Yes | Since November 2018 amendments |
| Mandatory breach records retention | 24 months | Records of all breaches, not just reported ones |

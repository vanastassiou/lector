# 3.10: Know required contents of a PIA report

Source: IAPP CIPP/C Body of Knowledge

## Key concepts

- **PIA report purpose**: Documents the privacy analysis and risk assessment for a
  program, system, or activity
  - Provides a structured record of privacy considerations
  - Serves as evidence of due diligence and compliance
  - Informs stakeholders of privacy risks and mitigations
  - Supports accountability under the Privacy Act
  - Published summary promotes transparency with the public

- **Program or activity description**: Foundational section describing what is being
  assessed
  - Name and purpose of the program, system, or activity
  - Legal authority for the program (enabling legislation or policy)
  - Business objectives and intended outcomes
  - Description of personal information flows
  - Stakeholders involved (internal and external)

- **Personal information inventory**: Documents what personal information is
  involved
  - Types and categories of personal information collected
  - Sources of personal information (individuals, other institutions, third parties)
  - Volume and sensitivity of information
  - Personal Information Banks (PIBs) created or modified
  - Data elements mapped to collection purposes

- **Privacy analysis**: Core assessment of privacy implications
  - Necessity and proportionality of collection (minimum collection principle)
  - Legal basis for collection, use, and disclosure
  - Consistency with the purpose stated at time of collection
  - Alignment with the 10 CSA privacy principles
  - Compliance with Privacy Act requirements
  - Whether consent applies or exceptions are invoked

- **Risk identification and assessment**: Systematic identification of privacy risks
  - Risks to individuals if personal information is mishandled
  - Likelihood and severity of potential harms
  - Risks from data sharing, matching, or integration with other systems
  - Risks from third-party access or outsourced processing
  - Data residency and cross-border transfer risks
  - Emerging technology risks (AI, analytics, cloud)

- **Mitigation measures**: Planned controls and safeguards to address identified
  risks
  - Administrative safeguards (policies, procedures, training)
  - Technical safeguards (encryption, access controls, logging)
  - Physical safeguards (secure facilities, access restrictions)
  - Contractual protections with third parties
  - Privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) where applicable
  - Residual risk after mitigations applied

- **Retention and disposal**: How long personal information will be kept and how it
  will be destroyed
  - Retention period justified by program requirements
  - Alignment with institutional retention schedules
  - Secure disposal methods (destruction, anonymization)
  - Third-party data return or destruction requirements

- **Access and correction procedures**: How individuals can exercise their rights
  - Procedures for individuals to access their personal information
  - Process for requesting corrections
  - Response timelines compliant with Privacy Act (30 days)
  - Notification of access and correction rights

- **Governance and accountability**: Who is responsible for privacy compliance
  - Designated officials accountable for the program
  - Role of ATIP coordinator or privacy office
  - Ongoing monitoring and review mechanisms
  - Complaint handling procedures
  - Reporting to senior management and deputy head

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| New benefit program collecting SIN, income data | PIA must identify sensitivity, justify necessity, document strong safeguards | Sensitive data requires thorough risk assessment |
| Cloud-based system with US data center | PIA must address data residency, foreign access risks, contractual protections | Cross-border storage creates additional privacy risks |
| Program sharing data with provincial agencies | PIA documents information sharing agreements, legal basis, limits on use | Data sharing requires explicit risk analysis |
| System using automated decision-making | PIA addresses transparency, accuracy, bias risks, human review options | AI/automation introduces specific privacy considerations |
| Contractor will process personal information | PIA includes third-party risks, contractual safeguards, oversight mechanisms | Third-party processing requires accountability coverage |
| Program involves data matching from multiple sources | PIA documents matching criteria, data quality, accuracy verification | Data matching increases re-identification and error risks |

## Gotchas

- **PIA report is not just a checklist**: A complete PIA requires substantive
  analysis, not merely filling in template fields. Exam questions may present
  scenarios where superficial compliance (e.g., listing data elements without
  analyzing sensitivity) is insufficient.

- **Legal authority must be documented**: The PIA must identify the legal authority
  for collecting personal information. Collection without proper authority is a
  fundamental compliance failure regardless of how well the PIA addresses other
  elements.

- **Mitigations must be specific and actionable**: Vague statements like "appropriate
  security measures will be implemented" are insufficient. The PIA should specify
  what controls will be used (e.g., AES-256 encryption, role-based access control).

- **Third-party arrangements require detail**: When contractors or service providers
  handle personal information, the PIA must address their obligations, oversight
  mechanisms, and contractual protections. Simply stating "contractor will protect
  data" is inadequate.

- **Data residency must be addressed**: If personal information will be stored or
  processed outside Canada, the PIA must evaluate foreign access risks and document
  any data residency requirements or exemptions.

- **Retention justification is required**: The PIA must justify retention periods
  based on program necessity, not just state a number of years. Retaining data
  longer than necessary is a privacy risk.

- **PIA summary differs from full PIA**: Federal institutions must submit a summary
  to TBS and OPC and publish it. The summary is a condensed version; the full PIA
  with detailed analysis is maintained internally.

- **PIBs must be addressed**: If the program creates new Personal Information Banks
  or modifies existing ones, the PIA should document this and ensure PIB
  registration is completed.

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Required for | Federal government institutions | Under Treasury Board Directive |
| Core sections | Description, inventory, analysis, risks, mitigations | Minimum required elements |
| Submission | PIA summary to TBS and OPC | Summary, not full PIA |
| Publication | PIA summaries published | Transparency requirement |
| Retention schedule | Must align with institutional schedules | Library and Archives Canada requirements |
| Access timeline | 30 days | Privacy Act requirement |
| Third-party coverage | Must be included | If contractors handle PI |
| PIB documentation | Required | If new or modified PIBs |
| Review cycle | Ongoing | Update when program changes |

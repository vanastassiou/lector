# 1.10: Understand significance of court and commissioner rulings on privacy law interpretation

Source: IAPP CIPP/C Body of Knowledge (Version 3.1.0, Effective 1 Sept. 2025)

## Key concepts

- **Precedential weight of court decisions**: Canadian courts establish binding
  and persuasive precedent that shapes how privacy statutes are interpreted.
  - Supreme Court of Canada decisions bind all lower courts
  - Federal Court and Federal Court of Appeal decisions guide PIPEDA
    interpretation
  - Provincial superior court decisions affect provincial privacy laws
  - Judicial interpretation fills gaps where statutory language is ambiguous

- **Commissioner findings as interpretive guidance**: Privacy commissioner
  decisions, while varying in binding authority, establish practical standards
  for compliance.
  - Federal OPC findings are recommendations, not binding orders
  - Alberta, BC, and Quebec commissioners issue binding orders
  - Published decisions create de facto compliance benchmarks
  - Commissioner interpretations influence how courts view organizational conduct

- **Relationship between commissioners and courts**: The enforcement system
  creates a two-tier interpretive structure.
  - Commissioner handles initial investigation and interpretation
  - Courts provide final adjudication when matters are appealed or referred
  - Federal Court may adopt, modify, or reject OPC interpretations
  - Courts give deference to commissioner expertise on technical privacy matters

- **Evolution of privacy principles through case law**: Key concepts develop
  through successive decisions.
  - "Personal information" scope expands through interpretation
  - "Reasonable expectations" doctrine refined by courts
  - Consent requirements clarified by commissioner findings and court rulings
  - Sensitivity determinations established through case-by-case analysis

- **Impact of rulings on organizational compliance**: Organizations must adapt
  practices based on interpretive developments.
  - New rulings may invalidate previously acceptable practices
  - Commissioner guidance signals enforcement priorities
  - Court decisions establish legal boundaries organizations cannot cross
  - Industry-specific rulings create sector expectations

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| OPC issues finding on data practice similar to yours | Review and align practices with Commissioner interpretation | Published findings establish compliance expectations even without binding authority |
| Federal Court overturns OPC recommendation | Follow court interpretation over Commissioner position | Court decisions are binding; Commissioner findings are advisory |
| Provincial commissioner issues order in another province | Consider whether reasoning applies to your jurisdiction | Cross-provincial decisions may signal emerging interpretive trends |
| Court narrows definition of consent exception | Update consent practices to reflect stricter interpretation | Judicial narrowing creates new compliance requirements |
| Commissioner publishes guidance document | Treat as current enforcement expectations | Guidance reflects how Commissioner will interpret future complaints |
| Court decision contradicts prior Commissioner position | Follow court decision; monitor for Commissioner response | Courts have final interpretive authority on statutory meaning |

## Gotchas

- **OPC findings are persuasive but not binding.** Organizations sometimes
  mistakenly treat OPC findings as legally binding. While courts give deference
  to Commissioner expertise, only court orders and provincial commissioner
  orders (AB, BC, QC) have direct legal force.

- **Court deference to commissioners is not absolute.** Courts will reject
  commissioner interpretations that conflict with statutory language or
  established legal principles. Organizations should not assume Commissioner
  positions will always be upheld.

- **Provincial decisions may influence federal interpretation.** Although
  provincial commissioner orders apply only within their jurisdiction, their
  reasoning may influence how the OPC and Federal Court interpret similar
  PIPEDA provisions.

- **Historical practices may become non-compliant.** Court or commissioner
  decisions can retroactively make common industry practices non-compliant.
  Organizations should monitor rulings proactively, not just when directly
  affected.

- **Guidance documents are not frozen in time.** Commissioner positions evolve.
  Relying on outdated guidance can lead to findings of non-compliance when
  enforcement priorities shift.

- **Consent interpretations have narrowed over time.** Courts and commissioners
  have progressively required more specific, informed, and meaningful consent.
  What constituted valid consent years ago may not meet current standards.

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Supreme Court of Canada decisions | Binding on all courts | Final authority on constitutional privacy issues |
| Federal Court/FCA decisions | Binding precedent for PIPEDA | Lower courts must follow |
| OPC findings | Persuasive only | Not legally binding; courts may adopt or reject |
| AB, BC, QC commissioner orders | Binding within jurisdiction | Order-making authority differs from OPC |
| Time to appeal to Federal Court | 1 year | From Commissioner's final report under PIPEDA |
| Court review standard | Reasonableness | Courts review Commissioner interpretations deferentially |

# 1.7: Know the role and powers of the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada (OPC)

Source: IAPP CIPP/C Body of Knowledge (Version 3.1.0, Effective 1 Sept. 2025)

## Key concepts

- **Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada (OPC)**: An independent Officer
  of Parliament responsible for overseeing compliance with both PIPEDA (private
  sector) and the Privacy Act (federal public sector). The Commissioner is
  appointed by the Governor in Council after approval by both houses of
  Parliament.
  - Reports directly to Parliament, not to the government
  - Seven-year term, renewable once
  - Current structure includes Deputy Commissioners and specialized branches

- **Ombudsman model under PIPEDA**: The OPC operates as an ombudsman rather
  than a regulator with direct enforcement power. This means:
  - Cannot issue binding orders against organizations
  - Makes findings and recommendations that organizations may choose to follow
  - Relies on persuasion, public reporting, and court applications for
    enforcement
  - Can refer matters to Federal Court if organization does not comply

- **Investigation powers**: The Commissioner has broad investigative authority:
  - Receive and investigate complaints from individuals
  - Initiate Commissioner-initiated complaints (own-motion investigations)
  - Summon witnesses and compel testimony under oath
  - Enter premises and examine records (with warrant or consent)
  - Audit organization practices proactively

- **Finding categories**: After investigation, the OPC issues findings:
  - Well-founded: Complaint is substantiated
  - Well-founded and resolved: Issue confirmed and corrected during investigation
  - Not well-founded: Complaint lacks merit
  - Settled: Parties reached agreement during investigation
  - Discontinued: Investigation ended without findings (e.g., withdrawn)

- **Federal Court application**: If an organization does not comply with OPC
  recommendations, the Commissioner or complainant can apply to Federal Court
  for:
  - Order requiring organization to correct practices
  - Award of damages to the complainant (including damages for humiliation)
  - Any other order the court considers appropriate

- **Public education and guidance**: The OPC fulfills a significant education
  mandate:
  - Publishes guidance documents on privacy topics
  - Issues findings and reports that establish interpretive precedent
  - Provides information on privacy rights to the public
  - Conducts research on emerging privacy issues

- **Annual reporting**: The Commissioner tables annual reports to Parliament
  covering:
  - Complaint statistics and trends
  - Significant findings from investigations
  - Recommendations for legislative reform
  - Assessment of privacy threats and emerging issues

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Individual believes organization mishandled personal information | File complaint with OPC under PIPEDA | OPC investigates private sector complaints; 1-year limitation from when complainant knew of grounds |
| Organization disagrees with OPC finding | Organization may decline to follow recommendation | OPC cannot issue binding orders; matter may proceed to Federal Court |
| OPC recommends organizational changes | Organization should implement or explain refusal | Non-compliance may result in Federal Court application and public reporting |
| Commissioner identifies systemic privacy issue | OPC may launch Commissioner-initiated complaint | Own-motion investigations address sector-wide concerns without individual complainant |
| Complainant wants damages for privacy violation | File Federal Court application after OPC finding | OPC cannot award damages; only Federal Court has that authority |
| Organization wants to demonstrate compliance proactively | Request OPC advisory opinion or compliance review | OPC offers consultative services separate from enforcement |

## Gotchas

- **The OPC cannot issue binding orders under PIPEDA.** Unlike provincial
  commissioners in Alberta, BC, and Quebec, the federal Privacy Commissioner
  makes recommendations only. Organizations can refuse to comply, though this
  may result in Federal Court proceedings and reputational consequences.

- **Findings are not legally binding but carry significant weight.** While OPC
  findings are not court orders, Federal Courts give substantial deference to
  the Commissioner's expertise. Published findings establish practical
  expectations for compliance.

- **The limitation period is one year from knowledge, not from the incident.**
  A complainant has one year from when they became aware (or reasonably should
  have become aware) of the grounds for complaint, not from when the privacy
  violation occurred.

- **Commissioner-initiated complaints do not require an individual complainant.**
  The OPC can investigate organizations on its own motion when it has reason
  to believe a violation occurred. This enables investigation of systemic
  issues.

- **The Privacy Act and PIPEDA have different enforcement mechanisms.** Under
  the Privacy Act (public sector), the Commissioner also lacks order-making
  power, but complaints proceed to Federal Court rather than following the
  PIPEDA application process.

## Key concepts

- **Privacy officer**: The designated individual accountable for an organization's
  privacy compliance under PIPEDA's Principle 1 (Accountability).
  - Must have authority to implement and oversee the privacy program
  - Serves as the primary contact for privacy inquiries and complaints
  - Reports to senior leadership on compliance status
  - May be a dedicated role or assigned to an existing position

- **Senior management/executive leadership**: Establishes the organizational
  commitment to privacy and provides resources for compliance.
  - Sets the tone from the top for privacy culture
  - Approves privacy policies and budgets
  - Bears ultimate organizational accountability
  - Ensures privacy is integrated into business strategy

- **Legal counsel**: Provides interpretation of privacy legislation and advises
  on compliance obligations.
  - Interprets PIPEDA and provincial privacy law requirements
  - Reviews contracts for third-party accountability provisions
  - Advises on consent language and policy wording
  - Supports response to complaints and regulatory inquiries

- **Information technology**: Implements technical safeguards and manages
  systems that process personal information.
  - Deploys encryption, access controls, and security measures
  - Maintains data inventories and system documentation
  - Implements privacy-enhancing technologies
  - Supports breach detection and response capabilities

- **Human resources**: Manages employee personal information and supports
  privacy training initiatives.
  - Handles employee data in compliance with applicable law
  - Coordinates privacy awareness training programs
  - Implements access controls for HR systems
  - Manages employee-related access requests

- **Business units/operational staff**: Front-line personnel who collect and
  handle personal information in daily operations.

  - Report privacy incidents through proper channels

- **Information security**: Develops and maintains safeguards protecting
  personal information from unauthorized access.
  - Implements administrative, technical, and physical safeguards
  - Conducts risk assessments and vulnerability testing

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Customer complains about data handling | Privacy officer receives and investigates complaint; coordinates with relevant departments | Privacy officer is the designated contact for compliance issues |
| New system processes personal information | IT implements technical safeguards; privacy officer reviews for compliance; legal advises on consent | Multiple stakeholders contribute expertise to ensure compliant implementation |
| Employee requests access to their file | HR coordinates with privacy officer to fulfill request within timelines | HR manages employee data; privacy officer ensures proper process |
| Third party experiences a data breach | Privacy officer coordinates response; legal advises on notification; IT supports investigation | Organization remains accountable; stakeholders work together under privacy officer coordination |
| Board asks about privacy compliance | Privacy officer reports to senior management; senior management reports to board | Accountability flows upward; privacy officer provides operational visibility |
| Marketing wants to use customer data for new purpose | Privacy officer reviews against original consent; legal advises on requirements | Cross-functional consultation before expanding data use |

## Gotchas

- **Accountability cannot be delegated away**: While the privacy officer
  coordinates compliance, organizational accountability remains with the
  organization itself. Designating a privacy officer does not shield senior
  management from responsibility.

- **Privacy officer title is not mandatory**: PIPEDA requires an accountable
  individual, not a specific job title. The function matters more than the
  label, though "privacy officer" is common practice.

- **All employees share responsibility**: Privacy is not solely the privacy
  officer's job. Every employee who handles personal information has a role
  in compliance through proper data handling practices.

- **Third parties do not assume your accountability**: When outsourcing to
  service providers, the organization retains accountability. Contractual
  arrangements create obligations but do not transfer fundamental
  responsibility.

- **Privacy officer needs adequate authority**: A privacy officer without
  access to senior leadership or sufficient resources cannot effectively
  fulfill the accountability requirement. Authority must match responsibility.

- **IT and security are distinct from privacy**: While technical safeguards
  are essential, privacy compliance extends beyond security to include
  consent, purpose limitation, access rights, and transparency. These
  functions must work together.

- **Cross-functional coordination is required**: Privacy compliance cannot
  operate in a silo. Effective programs require coordination between privacy,
  legal, IT, HR, security, and business units.

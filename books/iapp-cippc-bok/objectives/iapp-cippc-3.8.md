# 3.8: Follow storage, retention, and destruction requirements

Source: IAPP CIPP/C Body of Knowledge

## Key concepts

- **Storage requirements under the Privacy Act (section 6(2))**: Personal
  information used for administrative purposes must be retained long enough for
  individuals to exercise their access and correction rights
  - Two-year minimum retention period after last use for administrative decisions
  - Applies to personal information used to make decisions about identifiable
    individuals
  - Purpose is to ensure individuals can challenge decisions based on their
    personal information
  - Storage location must be in Canada for information under federal control

- **Personal Information Banks (PIBs) and retention schedules**: Government
  institutions must maintain retention and disposal schedules for PIBs
  - Library and Archives Canada approves records disposition authorities (RDAs)
  - Each PIB must have an associated retention period and disposition action
  - Disposition may be destruction or transfer to Library and Archives Canada
  - Schedules ensure systematic management of personal information lifecycle

- **Security safeguards during storage (section 6(3))**: Government institutions
  must protect personal information during storage
  - Administrative, technical, and physical safeguards required
  - Protection level must be commensurate with sensitivity of information
  - Applies throughout the retention period until proper destruction
  - Treasury Board policies provide detailed security standards

- **Destruction requirements**: Personal information must be destroyed securely
  when retention period expires and no legal hold applies
  - Destruction must be complete and irreversible
  - Methods include shredding, secure electronic deletion, degaussing
  - Must ensure information cannot be reconstructed or retrieved
  - Documentation of destruction may be required for audit purposes

- **Accuracy principle (section 6(1))**: Personal information used for
  administrative purposes must be as accurate, up to date, and complete as
  possible
  - Accuracy requirement continues throughout retention period
  - Institutions must take reasonable steps to verify accuracy before use
  - Connects to individual's right of correction under section 12(2)

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Employment file used to deny promotion | Retain for minimum two years after decision | Section 6(2) requires retention to allow access and challenge |
| Benefit application processed and granted | Retain according to RDA for the program; minimum two years if used for decisions | Must allow individual to access and verify information used |
| Paper records containing personal information to be disposed | Use cross-cut shredding or secure destruction service | Physical destruction must prevent reconstruction |
| Electronic database records past retention period | Apply secure deletion methods; document destruction | Electronic destruction must be complete and verifiable |
| Individual requests access 18 months after decision | Provide access; records must still be available | Within mandatory two-year retention period |
| Legal hold issued due to litigation | Suspend destruction regardless of retention schedule | Legal obligations override normal disposition |
| Personal information transferred to contractor | Ensure contract requires equivalent protection and proper destruction | Accountability extends to third-party handling |
| Archives-worthy records with personal information | Transfer to Library and Archives Canada per RDA | Some records have historical value and are preserved |

## Gotchas

- **Two years is a minimum, not a maximum**: Section 6(2) requires at least two
  years of retention after information is used for administrative purposes.
  Program-specific requirements or records disposition authorities may mandate
  longer periods. Exam questions may test whether candidates understand this is
  a floor, not a ceiling.

- **"Administrative purpose" is the trigger**: The two-year retention
  requirement applies when personal information is used to make decisions about
  an identifiable individual. Information collected but not used for decisions
  may have different retention requirements.

- **Retention starts from last use, not collection**: The two-year clock begins
  when the information is last used for an administrative purpose, not when it
  was originally collected. Ongoing use resets the retention period.

- **Legal holds override retention schedules**: When litigation is anticipated
  or commenced, normal destruction schedules must be suspended. Destroying
  information subject to a legal hold is spoliation and may result in adverse
  inferences or sanctions.

- **Provincial public sector laws vary**: Federal Privacy Act requirements apply
  to federal institutions. Provincial and territorial FOIPPAs may specify
  different retention periods. Alberta, British Columbia, and other provinces
  have their own public sector retention frameworks.

- **Destruction must be complete**: Simply deleting files or placing paper in
  regular waste is insufficient. Secure destruction means the information cannot
  be recovered. Forensic recovery of improperly destroyed data can lead to
  privacy breaches.

- **Third-party storage requires equivalent protection**: When contractors or
  cloud providers store personal information on behalf of government, contracts
  must specify security standards, retention requirements, and proper
  destruction obligations. Accountability remains with the government
  institution.

- **Info Source must reflect accurate retention information**: The published
  description of PIBs in Info Source should include retention periods. Outdated
  or inaccurate Info Source entries can mislead individuals about their access
  rights.

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Minimum retention for administrative use | 2 years | From last use for decision-making |
| Records disposition authority | Required | Library and Archives Canada approval |
| Storage location | Canada | Federal information under federal control |
| Security standard | Commensurate with sensitivity | Treasury Board policy guidance |
| Destruction method | Secure and irreversible | Shredding, degaussing, secure deletion |
| Third-party obligations | Contractual requirements | Must match government standards |
| Legal hold | Suspends destruction | Preservation required during litigation |
| Oversight | Privacy Commissioner | May audit retention and destruction practices |

  available for access requests during the mandatory period

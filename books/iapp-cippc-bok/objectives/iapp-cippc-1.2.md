# 1.2: Apply concepts and development of fair information practices (FIPPs)

Source: IAPP CIPP/C Body of Knowledge

## Key concepts

- **Fair Information Practices (FIPPs)**: Foundational privacy principles that govern
  the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information; originated in the 1970s
  and form the basis for modern privacy legislation worldwide, including Canadian laws.
- **1973 HEW Report**: U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare report that
  first articulated fair information practices as a response to computerized record-
  keeping; established the conceptual framework later adopted internationally.
- **OECD Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal
  Data (1980)**: Eight principles adopted by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
  and Development; became the international standard and directly influenced Canadian
  privacy law development.
  - Collection Limitation Principle
  - Data Quality Principle
  - Purpose Specification Principle
  - Use Limitation Principle
  - Security Safeguards Principle
  - Openness Principle
  - Individual Participation Principle
  - Accountability Principle
- **CSA Model Code for the Protection of Personal Information (1996)**: Canadian
  Standards Association voluntary code that adapted OECD principles for Canadian
  context; adopted as Schedule 1 to PIPEDA, making it legally binding for private
  sector organizations.
  - Ten principles: Accountability, Identifying Purposes, Consent, Limiting Collection,
    Limiting Use/Disclosure/Retention, Accuracy, Safeguards, Openness, Individual
    Access, Challenging Compliance.
- **Generally Accepted Privacy Principles (GAPP)**: Framework developed by AICPA and
  CICA (now CPA Canada); provides ten principles with measurable criteria for privacy
  program implementation and auditing.

## OECD principles mapped to Canadian law

| OECD Principle | CSA/PIPEDA Equivalent | Core requirement |
| -------------- | --------------------- | ---------------- |
| Collection Limitation | Limiting Collection | Collect only what is necessary; use fair and lawful means; obtain consent where appropriate |
| Data Quality | Accuracy | Personal information must be accurate, complete, and current for its intended purpose |
| Purpose Specification | Identifying Purposes | State purposes at or before collection; document purposes |
| Use Limitation | Limiting Use, Disclosure, Retention | Use/disclose only for stated purposes or with consent; retain only as long as necessary |
| Security Safeguards | Safeguards | Protect against loss, unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure |
| Openness | Openness | Make policies and practices readily available; be transparent about information handling |
| Individual Participation | Individual Access | Individuals can access their data, challenge accuracy, and have corrections made |
| Accountability | Accountability | Designate individual(s) responsible; ensure compliance throughout organization |

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Organization collects more data than needed "just in case" | Violates Collection Limitation; collect only what is necessary for identified purposes | FIPPs require minimization; excess collection increases privacy risk |
| Customer asks what personal information the company holds | Provide access within 30 days under PIPEDA; apply Individual Participation principle | Access is a fundamental right under both OECD and CSA frameworks |
| Collected data is used for a new marketing campaign | Obtain fresh consent or ensure new use falls within original stated purposes | Use Limitation restricts secondary uses without consent |
| Third-party processor will handle customer data | Ensure contractual safeguards; organization remains accountable | Accountability principle extends to third parties |
| Privacy policy is buried in legal jargon on website | Revise to be readily understandable and accessible | Openness requires genuine transparency, not technical compliance |

## Gotchas

- **OECD Guidelines are not legally binding**: They are recommendations that influenced
  legislation; the CSA Model Code in PIPEDA Schedule 1 is enforceable law in Canada.
- **CSA Model Code has 10 principles, not 8**: The OECD's eight principles were
  expanded to ten in the Canadian context - notably splitting some principles and
  adding "Challenging Compliance."
- **Accountability goes beyond designation**: Having a privacy officer is not
  sufficient; the organization must implement policies, procedures, training, and
  demonstrate compliance throughout all operations.
- **Consent is not always required for collection**: FIPPs allow collection without
  consent in specific circumstances (employment necessity, legal requirements, publicly
  available information); the principle is "consent where appropriate."
- **GAPP vs. CSA Model Code**: GAPP is an auditing/assurance framework with measurable
  criteria; CSA Model Code is the legal standard in PIPEDA. Both derive from FIPPs but
  serve different purposes.

## Historical development

| Year | Development | Significance |
| ---- | ----------- | ------------ |
| 1973 | HEW Report (U.S.) | First articulation of FIPPs |
| 1980 | OECD Guidelines adopted | International consensus on privacy principles |
| 1996 | CSA Model Code published | Canadian voluntary standard adapting OECD principles |
| 2001 | PIPEDA comes into force (Phase 1) | CSA Model Code becomes Schedule 1; federal law applies to federally regulated industries |
| 2004 | PIPEDA full application | Extends to all commercial activities in provinces without substantially similar legislation |

## Related topics

- **Schedule 1 to PIPEDA**: Contains the CSA Model Code; understanding the ten
  principles is essential for applying PIPEDA's requirements.
- **Substantially similar provincial legislation**: Alberta PIPA, BC PIPA, and Quebec's
  private sector law implement FIPPs principles with provincial variations.
- **Privacy by Design**: Modern evolution of FIPPs; embeds privacy principles into
  system design rather than retrofitting compliance.
- **Accountability frameworks**: OPC guidance on demonstrating accountability builds
  directly on the first CSA/FIPPs principle.

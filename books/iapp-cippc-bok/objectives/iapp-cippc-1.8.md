# 1.8: Understand the complaint and investigation process for privacy breaches

Source: IAPP CIPP/C Body of Knowledge (Version 3.1.0, Effective 1 Sept. 2025)

## Key concepts

- **Privacy breach vs. privacy complaint**: A privacy breach is an unauthorized
  access to, disclosure of, or loss of personal information. A complaint is a
  formal allegation by an individual that an organization has violated their
  privacy rights. Breaches may trigger complaints, but they are distinct
  processes with different reporting and investigation requirements.

- **Breach notification requirements under PIPEDA**: Organizations must report
  breaches that pose a "real risk of significant harm" (RROSH) to the Office of
  the Privacy Commissioner of Canada (OPC) and affected individuals.
  - Report to OPC "as soon as feasible" after determining RROSH exists
  - Notify affected individuals "as soon as feasible"
  - Maintain records of all breaches for 24 months (regardless of RROSH)
  - Notification to third parties may be required to mitigate harm

- **Real risk of significant harm (RROSH) assessment**: Organizations must
  evaluate whether a breach meets the RROSH threshold by considering:
  - Sensitivity of the personal information involved
  - Probability that the information will be misused
  - Types of harm that could result (bodily harm, humiliation, damage to
    reputation, financial loss, identity theft, negative effects on employment,
    business or professional opportunities)

- **OPC complaint investigation process**: The standard process for PIPEDA
  complaints follows these stages:
  - Intake: OPC receives complaint and confirms jurisdiction
  - Early resolution: Attempt to resolve without full investigation
  - Investigation: Formal examination of facts and practices
  - Finding: Commissioner issues determination (well-founded, not well-founded,
    settled, discontinued, well-founded and resolved)
  - Recommendation: If well-founded, OPC recommends corrective action

- **Filing a complaint with the OPC**: Individuals can file written complaints
  alleging PIPEDA violations.
  - Must be filed within one year of when the complainant became aware (or
    reasonably should have become aware) of the grounds for complaint
  - OPC screens complaints for jurisdiction and admissibility
  - No fee to file a complaint
  - Complaints can also be filed with provincial commissioners where applicable

- **Commissioner-initiated investigations**: The Privacy Commissioner can launch
  investigations without receiving a complaint (own-motion investigations) when:
  - There is reason to believe a violation has occurred
  - Systemic issues affect multiple individuals or organizations
  - A matter is of significant public interest
  - Audit or assessment reveals potential non-compliance

- **Provincial complaint processes**: Provincial commissioners (Alberta, BC,
  Quebec for private sector; all provinces for public sector and health) have
  their own complaint and investigation processes.
  - Alberta, BC, and Quebec commissioners have order-making power
  - Provincial breach notification requirements may differ from PIPEDA
  - Health sector breaches follow provincial health privacy act requirements

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Data breach affects 500 customers with financial information | Assess RROSH; if positive, notify OPC and affected individuals as soon as feasible | Financial data is sensitive; high probability of misuse triggers notification |
| Employee loses unencrypted laptop with HR records | Record breach; assess RROSH; notify if significant harm likely | All breaches must be recorded; RROSH determines notification requirement |
| Individual believes organization disclosed information without consent | File complaint with OPC or provincial commissioner within 1 year | Complaint triggers investigation; limitation period runs from knowledge |
| Organization receives complaint about access request denial | Respond to OPC investigation; provide requested documentation | Cooperation with investigation is expected; obstruction has consequences |
| Breach involves low-sensitivity data with minimal harm risk | Record breach but no notification required | RROSH threshold not met; still must maintain 24-month breach record |
| Data breach in Quebec involving Quebec residents | Report to Commission d'accès à l'information (CAI) | Quebec has its own breach notification regime under Law 25 |

## Gotchas

- **24-month breach record requirement applies to all breaches.** Organizations
  must maintain records of every breach involving personal information, not just
  those requiring notification. The OPC can request these records for review.

- **"As soon as feasible" does not mean "immediately."** Organizations have
  reasonable time to investigate and assess RROSH before notifying. However,
  unreasonable delays can result in findings of non-compliance.

- **The 1-year limitation period runs from knowledge, not from the incident.**
  If an individual discovers a privacy violation years after it occurred, they
  still have one year from discovery to file a complaint.

- **OPC findings are not legally binding orders.** Unlike Alberta, BC, and
  Quebec commissioners, the federal Privacy Commissioner can only make
  recommendations. Non-compliance may lead to Federal Court application but not
  direct enforcement.

- **Provincial breach notification may differ from PIPEDA.** Quebec's Law 25
  (effective 2022-2024) has specific breach notification requirements.
  Organizations must understand which regime applies based on jurisdiction.

- **Early resolution is not a finding.** If a matter is resolved during early
  resolution, the OPC does not issue a formal finding. This differs from
  "well-founded and resolved" which is a formal finding category.

- **Organizations cannot refuse to cooperate with OPC investigations.** The
  Commissioner has statutory powers to compel production of documents and
  testimony. Obstruction can result in additional complaints and reputational
  damage.

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Breach record retention | 24 months | From date organization determines breach occurred |
| Complaint limitation period | 1 year | From when complainant knew or should have known |
| OPC notification timing | As soon as feasible | After determining RROSH exists |
| Individual notification timing | As soon as feasible | After determining RROSH exists |
| OPC order-making power | None | Recommendations only; court application required |
| Alberta/BC/Quebec commissioner power | Order-making | Can issue binding compliance orders |
| Federal Court application deadline | 1 year | From date of Commissioner's final report |

# 3.9: Understand how and when to complete a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA)

Source: IAPP CIPP/C Body of Knowledge

## Key concepts

- **Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) definition**: A systematic process to identify
  and evaluate the privacy risks of a program, system, or activity involving
  personal information
  - Proactive tool used before implementation, not after
  - Documents privacy implications and planned mitigations
  - Required for federal government institutions under Treasury Board policy
  - Provincial and territorial public bodies have similar requirements under
    FOIPPAs

- **When a PIA is required**: Treasury Board Directive on Privacy Impact
  Assessment mandates PIAs for new or substantially modified programs and
  activities
  - New programs or activities involving personal information
  - Substantial modifications to existing programs that change privacy impact
  - Implementation of new systems or technologies handling personal information
  - Contracting out activities involving personal information
  - Data matching or data sharing initiatives
  - Not required for routine administrative activities with no change in privacy
    risk

- **Timing of PIAs**: Must be completed early in the planning and design phase
  - Before personal information is collected or used
  - Early enough to influence design decisions
  - Updated when significant changes occur to the program or system
  - Allows privacy-by-design principles to be incorporated
  - Late PIAs lose the opportunity to prevent privacy issues

- **Treasury Board Directive on Privacy Impact Assessment**: Core federal policy
  governing PIA requirements
  - Applies to all federal government institutions subject to the Privacy Act
  - Requires submission of PIA summaries to Treasury Board Secretariat and OPC
  - Mandates publication of completed PIA summaries
  - Institutions must maintain PIA documentation
  - Deputy heads are accountable for ensuring PIAs are conducted

- **Provincial PIA requirements**: Most provincial and territorial FOIPPAs require
  or recommend PIAs for public bodies
  - Alberta FOIP Act has mandatory PIA requirements for common or integrated
    programs
  - British Columbia requires PIAs for data-linking initiatives
  - Ontario IPC provides PIA guidance for provincial institutions
  - Requirements vary; some jurisdictions mandate submission to Privacy
    Commissioner

- **Role of the Privacy Commissioner**: OPC reviews federal PIAs and provides
  guidance
  - Receives PIA summaries from federal institutions
  - May comment on privacy risks and recommend additional mitigations
  - Does not formally approve or reject PIAs
  - Provides guidance materials on conducting effective PIAs
  - Provincial commissioners have varying roles in PIA review

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| New digital service portal collecting citizen data | Conduct PIA before launch; submit summary to TBS and OPC | New program involving personal information requires PIA |
| Upgrading an existing HR system with new analytics features | Assess if changes substantially modify privacy impact; conduct PIA if so | Substantial modifications trigger PIA requirement |
| Contracting cloud provider to process benefit applications | Conduct PIA addressing third-party handling, data location, safeguards | Contracting out personal information processing requires PIA |
| Routine server maintenance on existing system | No new PIA required | No change to privacy impact; routine technical work |
| Data matching initiative between two departments | Conduct PIA covering both institutions' data, matching criteria, retention | Data matching is specifically identified as PIA trigger |
| Program launched without PIA identified during audit | Complete PIA immediately; document gaps and remediation | Retroactive PIA required even though opportunity for design input was lost |
| Expanding an existing program to new provinces | Assess if expansion changes privacy impact; update PIA if needed | Geographic expansion may change risk profile |

## Gotchas

- **PIAs are proactive, not reactive**: The primary purpose of a PIA is to
  identify privacy risks before they materialize. Conducting a PIA after
  implementation misses the opportunity to incorporate privacy-by-design. Exam
  questions may present scenarios where candidates must recognize that early PIA
  timing is essential.

- **Substantial modification is the trigger, not any modification**: Not every
  change requires a new PIA. The test is whether the modification substantially
  changes the privacy impact. Minor updates that do not affect what information
  is collected, how it is used, or who has access typically do not require a new
  PIA.

- **PIA summaries must be submitted and published**: Federal institutions must
  submit PIA summaries to both Treasury Board Secretariat and the OPC. Summaries
  are also published for transparency. Failure to submit or publish is a
  compliance gap.

- **OPC does not approve PIAs**: The Office of the Privacy Commissioner reviews
  and may comment on PIAs but does not formally approve or reject them.
  Institutions are responsible for their own PIA decisions. Comments from OPC
  are advisory.

- **Provincial requirements differ from federal**: Each province and territory has
  its own PIA framework for public bodies. Some mandate PIA submission to the
  provincial commissioner; others provide guidance without mandatory submission.
  Exam questions may test knowledge of these differences.

- **Third-party involvement requires PIA coverage**: When contractors or service
  providers will handle personal information, the PIA must address these
  arrangements. Accountability remains with the government institution even when
  processing is outsourced.

- **Data location matters**: PIAs should address where personal information will
  be stored and processed. If cloud services or foreign data centers are
  involved, the PIA must evaluate associated risks and any applicable data
  residency requirements.

- **PIAs are living documents**: When programs change significantly, PIAs should
  be updated. A PIA completed at program launch may become outdated as the
  program evolves. Periodic review ensures continued relevance.

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Federal PIA authority | Treasury Board Directive on PIA | Mandatory for federal institutions |
| Timing | Before implementation | Early in planning/design phase |
| Submission | TBS and OPC | PIA summaries required |
| Publication | Required | Transparency obligation |
| OPC role | Advisory | Reviews but does not approve |
| Threshold | Substantial modification | Triggers new or updated PIA |
| Third-party coverage | Required | Contractor handling must be addressed |
| Provincial requirements | Vary by jurisdiction | Some mandatory, some guidance-based |
| Accountability | Deputy head | Institutional responsibility |

# 3.5: Recognize when collection, use, or disclosure is permitted without consent

Source: IAPP CIPP/C Body of Knowledge

## Key concepts

- **Privacy Act operates without a consent model**: Unlike PIPEDA, the Privacy
  Act authorizes collection, use, and disclosure through statutory provisions
  rather than individual consent
  - Consent is one of many permitted grounds for disclosure, not a default
    requirement
  - Authority derives from statutory mandates and program necessity
  - Understanding the specific exceptions is critical for exam questions

- **Collection without consent (section 4)**: Personal information may be
  collected if it relates directly to an operating program or activity
  - No consent requirement; collection is authorized by institutional mandate
  - Collection limited to information directly related to program purposes
  - Indirect collection permitted only with individual's consent or where
    authorized under section 4
  - Notification required under section 5, but notification is not consent

- **Use without consent - consistent use doctrine**: Information may be used
  for purposes beyond the original collection purpose if the use is consistent
  - Consistent use defined as use with a reasonable and direct connection to
    the original purpose
  - Treasury Board Secretariat (TBS) guidance provides interpretation framework
  - Institution must document rationale for determining consistency
  - Individuals cannot refuse authorized uses, unlike private-sector consent
    withdrawal

- **Section 7 - internal use exceptions**: Personal information under control
  of a government institution may be used for purposes it was obtained or
  compiled for, or a consistent use
  - Subsection (a): Use for the purpose collected or a consistent use
  - Subsection (b): Use for which information may be disclosed under section 8

- **Section 8(2) - disclosure exceptions**: The critical enumeration of
  permitted disclosure grounds without consent
  - Contains over 15 specific exceptions covering diverse situations
  - Each exception represents an independent legal authority to disclose
  - Consent under 8(2)(a) is one option, not a prerequisite

## Section 8(2) disclosure exceptions (exam-critical)

| Exception | Authority | Scope |
| --------- | --------- | ----- |
| 8(2)(a) - Consent | Individual consents | Optional, not required |
| 8(2)(b) - Consistent use | Same as collection purpose | Must document connection |
| 8(2)(c) - MP acting for individual | Member of Parliament | Constituent assistance |
| 8(2)(d) - Subpoena, court order | Legal proceedings | Compliance mandatory |
| 8(2)(e) - Law enforcement investigation | Canadian peace officer | Criminal investigation |
| 8(2)(f) - Federal-provincial agreement | Specified by agreement | Enforcement of law |
| 8(2)(g) - MP or Senator oversight | Members of Parliament | Government accountability |
| 8(2)(h) - Internal audit | Audit of government | Accountability purposes |
| 8(2)(i) - National Archives | Library and Archives Canada | Preservation mandate |
| 8(2)(j) - Research or statistics | Research purposes | Strict controls apply |
| 8(2)(k) - Aboriginal organization | First Nations, Inuit, Métis | Specific agreements |
| 8(2)(l) - Any person or body | Public interest | Head of institution discretion |
| 8(2)(m) - Benefit to individual | Disclosed for individual's benefit | Compassionate grounds |

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Applicable exception | Key consideration |
| -------- | -------------------- | ----------------- |
| RCMP requests employee records for criminal investigation | 8(2)(e) - Law enforcement | Must be investigation of specific offence; investigative body must be Canadian |
| Court issues subpoena for personal information | 8(2)(d) - Legal proceedings | Compliance is mandatory; document the disclosure |
| Researcher requests anonymized health data | 8(2)(j) - Research | Must ensure appropriate safeguards; may require ethics review |
| MP contacts department on behalf of constituent | 8(2)(c) - MP for individual | MP must be acting on individual's behalf; document request |
| Sharing personal info between federal departments | 8(2)(b) or (f) | If consistent use, use (b); if formal agreement exists, use (f) |
| Individual's family member seeks emergency disclosure | 8(2)(m) - Benefit to individual | Must clearly benefit the individual; compassionate circumstances |
| Audit of program by internal auditor | 8(2)(h) - Internal audit | Authorized for government accountability purposes |

## Gotchas

- **Consent is optional, not required**: Section 8(2)(a) permits disclosure
  with consent, but does not require it. If another exception applies, consent
  is unnecessary. Exam questions may test whether candidates incorrectly
  believe consent must always be sought first.

- **Law enforcement exception has limits**: Section 8(2)(e) applies only to
  investigations by Canadian peace officers into specific offences. Fishing
  expeditions or foreign law enforcement requests do not qualify under this
  provision.

- **Research exception requires safeguards**: Disclosure for research under
  8(2)(j) is not automatic. The head of the institution must be satisfied that
  the research purpose cannot be achieved without the personal information and
  that appropriate confidentiality protections exist.

- **Consistent use is not unlimited**: The consistent use exception under
  8(2)(b) requires a reasonable and direct connection to the original purpose.
  Remote or tangential connections do not qualify. TBS guidance emphasizes
  documentation of the consistency analysis.

- **Head of institution discretion under 8(2)(l)**: The public interest
  exception gives the head of the institution discretion to disclose to "any
  person or body" where clearly in the public interest. This broad authority
  requires careful exercise and documentation.

- **Provincial public sector laws differ**: Section 8(2) applies to federal
  institutions under the Privacy Act. Provincial FOIPPAs have their own
  disclosure provisions with different exception structures. Exam questions
  may distinguish federal from provincial exceptions.

- **Disclosure requires documentation**: All disclosures under section 8(2)
  must be recorded. Section 8(4) requires that requests for disclosure be
  recorded in the same manner as the information itself.

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Consent requirement | Not required | One of many disclosure grounds |
| Section 8(2) exceptions | 15+ enumerated grounds | Each is independent authority |
| Consistent use standard | Reasonable and direct connection | TBS guidance applies |
| Law enforcement scope | Canadian peace officers | Investigation of specific offence |
| Research disclosure | Head of institution discretion | Safeguards required |
| Disclosure record keeping | Mandatory | Section 8(4) requirement |
| Public interest disclosure | Head of institution discretion | Must be clearly in public interest |

# 2.9: Recognize when consent requirements may have exceptions

Source: IAPP CIPP/C Body of Knowledge

## Key concepts

- **Consent as the default rule**: PIPEDA Principle 3 requires knowledge and
  consent for the collection, use, or disclosure of personal information.
  However, the Act recognizes situations where obtaining consent is
  impractical, inappropriate, or would undermine legitimate purposes.
  - Exceptions are enumerated in sections 7(1), 7(2), and 7(3) of PIPEDA
  - Exceptions exist separately for collection, use, and disclosure
  - Organizations must document which exception applies when relying on one

- **Collection without consent (s. 7(1))**: Personal information may be
  collected without consent in limited circumstances:
  - Collection is clearly in the interests of the individual and consent
    cannot be obtained in a timely way
  - Collection is necessary for investigating a breach of agreement or law
  - Collection is for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes
  - Information is publicly available as specified in regulations
  - Collection is required by law

- **Use without consent (s. 7(2))**: Personal information may be used without
  consent when:
  - Used for purposes for which it was collected (and individual would
    reasonably expect such use)
  - Used for detecting and preventing fraud
  - Used for statistical or scholarly study or research (where consent is
    impractical and measures protect identity)
  - Used for an emergency threatening life, health, or security
  - Required by law

- **Disclosure without consent (s. 7(3))**: Personal information may be
  disclosed without consent in circumstances including:
  - Disclosure to a lawyer representing the organization
  - Disclosure to collect a debt
  - Disclosure required by law or court order
  - Disclosure to a government institution for law enforcement, national
    security, or administration of laws
  - Disclosure to comply with a subpoena or warrant
  - Disclosure for an emergency threatening life, health, or security
  - Disclosure for statistical or scholarly research (with safeguards)
  - Disclosure 20 years after death or 100 years after record creation for
    archival purposes

- **Business transaction exception**: PIPEDA allows disclosure and use of
  personal information without consent for prospective business transactions
  (mergers, acquisitions, asset sales) subject to conditions:
  - Information is necessary to determine whether to proceed
  - Confidentiality agreements are in place
  - Information is used only for transaction-related purposes
  - If transaction does not proceed, information must be returned or destroyed

- **Employment exception considerations**: While PIPEDA covers employee
  information for federally regulated works, undertakings, and businesses,
  the employment context may affect consent requirements:
  - Reasonable collection for employment relationship establishment
  - Investigation of workplace misconduct may qualify under breach exception
  - Provincial private sector laws may apply to provincially regulated
    employers (AB, BC, QC)

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Responding to a court order for customer records | Disclose without consent under s. 7(3) legal requirement exception | Law compels disclosure; consent not required |
| Investigating suspected employee fraud | Use existing records without additional consent under s. 7(2) investigation exception | Investigation of breach of agreement; consent could frustrate investigation |
| Collecting credit card information from a person in medical distress | Collect without consent under s. 7(1) individual interest exception | Collection clearly benefits individual; consent cannot be timely obtained |
| Sharing records with acquiring company during merger negotiations | Disclose under business transaction exception with confidentiality agreement | Transaction exception permits disclosure with safeguards |
| Police request for customer information (no warrant) | Evaluate whether s. 7(3) disclosure exception applies; may but not required to disclose | Exception permits but does not compel voluntary disclosure |
| Using customer data for internal fraud analytics | Use without consent under s. 7(2) fraud detection exception | Detecting and preventing fraud is an enumerated exception |
| Newspaper researching story involving business records | May collect and use under journalistic exception | Journalistic purposes are exempt from consent requirements |

## Gotchas

- **Exceptions permit but may not require disclosure**: Many disclosure
  exceptions are permissive ("may disclose") not mandatory. Organizations
  retain discretion to refuse voluntary disclosure even when an exception
  applies, except where legally compelled.

- **Police requests without warrant**: Law enforcement requests for personal
  information without a warrant may fall under s. 7(3) disclosure exceptions,
  but organizations are permitted, not required, to comply. Careful
  documentation of the request and rationale for response is essential.

- **Business transaction confidentiality is mandatory**: Relying on the
  business transaction exception requires confidentiality agreements limiting
  use to transaction purposes. Failure to obtain such agreements means the
  exception does not apply.

- **Legitimate business interests is not an exception**: Unlike some
  jurisdictions, PIPEDA does not include a broad "legitimate interests" basis
  for processing. Canadian organizations cannot rely on general business
  necessity as a consent exception.

- **Publicly available information has specific limits**: The regulations
  specify what qualifies as publicly available (telephone directories,
  professional registries, public records, publications). Not all information
  that appears public qualifies.

- **Statistical research requires safeguards**: The research exception for
  use and disclosure requires that obtaining consent would be impractical,
  the research cannot be done without the information, confidentiality is
  ensured, and consent is obtained if practicable before publication.

- **Emergency exception is narrow**: Threatening life, health, or security
  requires genuine urgency. Routine healthcare or security operations do not
  qualify as emergencies under this exception.

- **Documentation burden shifts to organization**: When relying on any
  exception, the organization bears the burden of demonstrating the exception
  applies. Document the specific exception, the circumstances, and the
  decision-making process.

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| PIPEDA section for collection exceptions | s. 7(1) | Lists circumstances for collection without consent |
| PIPEDA section for use exceptions | s. 7(2) | Lists circumstances for use without consent |
| PIPEDA section for disclosure exceptions | s. 7(3) | Lists circumstances for disclosure without consent |
| Default rule | Consent required | Exceptions are departures from the norm |
| Publicly available information regulation | SOR/2001-7 | Specifies what qualifies as publicly available |
| Archival disclosure threshold | 20 years after death or 100 years after creation | Whichever comes first |
| Business transaction requirement | Confidentiality agreement | Must limit use to transaction purposes |
| Research exception requirement | Consent impractical + identity protection | Both conditions must be met |

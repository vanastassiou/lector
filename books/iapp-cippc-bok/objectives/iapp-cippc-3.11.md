# 3.11: Know provincial and territorial public sector privacy legislation

Source: IAPP CIPP/C Body of Knowledge

## Key concepts

- **Provincial/territorial jurisdiction over public sector privacy**: Each province and
  territory has enacted its own public sector privacy legislation governing provincial
  and territorial government institutions
  - Authority derives from constitutional division of powers
  - Provincial governments have jurisdiction over their own institutions
  - Federal Privacy Act only applies to federal government institutions
  - Provincial acts typically combine access to information and privacy protection

- **Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy (FIPPA/FOIPPA) model**: Common
  legislative framework used across most provinces
  - British Columbia: Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA)
  - Alberta: Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FOIP Act)
  - Ontario: Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA)
  - Manitoba: Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA)
  - Saskatchewan: Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FOIP)
  - New Brunswick: Right to Information and Protection of Privacy Act (RTIPPA)
  - Nova Scotia: Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FOIPOP)
  - Prince Edward Island: Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FOIPP)
  - Newfoundland and Labrador: Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act
    (ATIPPA, 2015)
  - Quebec: Act respecting Access to documents held by public bodies and the Protection
    of personal information
  - Yukon: Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act (ATIPP)
  - Northwest Territories: Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act (ATIPP)
  - Nunavut: Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act (ATIPP)

- **Public bodies covered by provincial legislation**: Types of organizations subject
  to provincial public sector privacy laws
  - Provincial government ministries and departments
  - Provincial agencies, boards, and commissions
  - Crown corporations (provincial)
  - Municipalities and local governments
  - School boards and educational institutions
  - Public health authorities and hospitals (in some provinces)
  - Police services (provincial and municipal)
  - Universities and colleges (in most provinces)
  - Professional regulatory bodies (varies by province)

- **Key differences from federal Privacy Act**: Provincial legislation differs in
  structure and requirements
  - Often combines access to information with privacy protection in single statute
  - May have different timelines for responding to access requests
  - Different oversight models (commissioner powers vary)
  - May include additional rights not in federal Act (e.g., correction, annotation)
  - Some provinces have binding order-making power for commissioners
  - Breach notification requirements vary by province

- **Oversight models across provinces**: How privacy enforcement is structured
  - Some provinces have dedicated Privacy Commissioner
  - Some provinces have combined Information and Privacy Commissioner
  - Provinces without separate commissioner use Ombudsman model
  - Commissioner powers vary (recommendations vs. binding orders)
  - Alberta, British Columbia, and Ontario commissioners can issue binding orders
  - Some commissioners have audit and investigation powers

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| University handling student records in Ontario | FIPPA applies, not PIPEDA | Provincial public sector law governs public institutions |
| Municipal government in Alberta collecting resident data | Alberta FOIP Act applies | Municipalities are public bodies under provincial legislation |
| Federal agency operating in BC | Federal Privacy Act applies | Federal institution remains under federal jurisdiction |
| Provincial Crown corporation processing customer data | Provincial public sector law applies | Crown corporations are typically covered by provincial acts |
| Hospital in Ontario handling patient records | PHIPA (health) may apply alongside FIPPA | Health-specific legislation may take precedence or complement |
| Police service collecting personal information | Provincial act applies unless RCMP (federal) | Municipal/provincial police under provincial law |

## Gotchas

- **Federal vs. provincial jurisdiction confusion**: A public institution's
  jurisdiction depends on which level of government created and controls it, not where
  it operates. An RCMP officer in Ontario is under federal Privacy Act; a Toronto
  police officer is under Ontario FIPPA.

- **Universities are often provincial**: Despite receiving federal research funding,
  most universities are provincial public institutions governed by provincial privacy
  legislation, not PIPEDA.

- **Municipal governments are provincial**: Municipalities are creatures of provincial
  legislation and are governed by provincial public sector privacy laws, not federal
  law.

- **Commissioner powers vary significantly**: Not all provincial commissioners have
  the same enforcement powers. Some can only recommend; others (Alberta, BC, Ontario)
  can issue binding orders. Know which model applies.

- **Health sector may have separate legislation**: In provinces with specific health
  privacy legislation (Ontario PHIPA, Alberta HIA, etc.), health custodians may be
  governed by health-specific laws rather than or in addition to general public sector
  laws.

- **Crown corporations require careful analysis**: Whether a Crown corporation is
  federal or provincial determines which privacy law applies. Some Crown corporations
  also engage in commercial activities subject to private sector laws.

- **Ombudsman model differs from commissioner model**: In provinces using an Ombudsman
  for privacy oversight, the enforcement approach and available remedies may differ
  from dedicated commissioner offices.

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Provinces with FIPPA/FOIPPA-style legislation | All 10 provinces | Common framework, different names |
| Territories with public sector privacy laws | All 3 | Yukon, NWT, Nunavut each have ATIPP |
| Commissioners with binding order power | AB, BC, ON | Others have recommendation-only authority |
| Provinces using Ombudsman model | Varies | No dedicated privacy commissioner |
| Access request response time | Typically 30 days | Varies by province, extensions may apply |
| Municipal coverage | All provinces | Municipalities under provincial legislation |
| University coverage | Most provinces | Generally treated as public bodies |

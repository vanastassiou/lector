# 4.3: Know health privacy laws across provinces and territories

Source: IAPP CIPP/C Body of Knowledge (Version 3.1.0, Effective 1 Sept. 2025)

## Key concepts

- **Provincial jurisdiction over health privacy**: Canada has no federal health
  privacy legislation. Each province has enacted its own health-sector-specific
  privacy statute governing personal health information (PHI) held by health
  information custodians. Understanding the applicable provincial law is
  essential for health sector compliance.

- **Provincial health privacy statutes**: Major provincial health acts include:
  - Ontario: Personal Health Information Protection Act (PHIPA), 2004
  - Alberta: Health Information Act (HIA), 2001
  - Manitoba: Personal Health Information Act (PHIA), 1997
  - Saskatchewan: Health Information Protection Act (HIPA), 1999
  - New Brunswick: Personal Health Information Privacy and Access Act (PHIPAA),
    2009
  - Newfoundland and Labrador: Personal Health Information Act (PHIA), 2008
  - Nova Scotia: Personal Health Information Act (PHIA), 2010

- **Provinces without dedicated health acts**: British Columbia, Quebec, and
  Prince Edward Island do not have standalone health privacy legislation.
  In these jurisdictions, PHI is governed by general private sector or public
  sector privacy laws:
  - British Columbia: Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA) and Freedom of
    Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA)
  - Quebec: Act Respecting the Protection of Personal Information in the Private
    Sector (Quebec Private Sector Act) and Act Respecting Access to Documents
    Held by Public Bodies
  - PEI: Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FOIPP)

- **Territories**: Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut do not have
  health-specific privacy legislation. Health information is governed by access
  and privacy legislation or, for private sector activities, PIPEDA may apply.

- **Alberta Health Information Act (HIA)**: Governs PHI held by health
  custodians including regional health authorities, physicians, pharmacists, and
  Alberta Health. HIA emphasizes individual access rights and requires consent
  for most uses and disclosures outside treatment purposes. The Office of the
  Information and Privacy Commissioner of Alberta (OIPC) provides oversight.

- **Manitoba Personal Health Information Act (PHIA)**: Among the earliest
  provincial health acts (1997). Covers trustees including health professionals,
  hospitals, and government bodies. Manitoba PHIA requires consent for
  collection, use, and disclosure with exceptions for treatment and public
  health purposes.

- **Saskatchewan Health Information Protection Act (HIPA)**: Applies to
  trustees (health facilities, government institutions, health professionals).
  HIPA contains strong consent requirements and permits implied consent within
  the circle of care. Administered by Saskatchewan's Information and Privacy
  Commissioner.

- **Atlantic provinces health acts**: New Brunswick (PHIPAA), Newfoundland and
  Labrador (PHIA), and Nova Scotia (PHIA) each govern PHI held by health
  custodians with variations in definitions, consent requirements, and oversight
  mechanisms.

- **Substantially similar status**: Ontario's PHIPA, Alberta's HIA, Manitoba's
  PHIA, and New Brunswick's PHIPAA have been deemed substantially similar to
  PIPEDA for health sector purposes. This means PIPEDA does not apply to health
  information custodians in those provinces.

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Alberta physician shares PHI with hospital | Follow Alberta HIA requirements | Both are custodians under HIA; consent or exception required |
| BC clinic handles patient records | Apply BC PIPA (private) or FIPPA (public) | BC has no standalone health privacy act |
| Manitoba lab discloses test results to physician | Implied consent within circle of care | PHIA permits treatment-related disclosure |
| Saskatchewan researcher requests PHI access | Require ethics approval and consent or waiver | HIPA has specific research provisions |
| Quebec hospital manages patient data | Follow Quebec public sector privacy law | No dedicated health privacy act |
| PEI private clinic collects PHI | PIPEDA may apply | No provincial health or private sector act |
| Ontario and Alberta institutions share PHI | Comply with both PHIPA and HIA | Cross-provincial transfer requires meeting both laws |
| NWT health center processes patient records | Follow territorial access and privacy legislation | No territory-specific health act |

## Gotchas

- **Substantially similar does not mean identical.** While several health acts
  are deemed substantially similar to PIPEDA, each has distinct provisions.
  Consent requirements, access rights, breach notification rules, and oversight
  mechanisms differ across provinces.

- **Custodian definitions vary.** Each provincial act defines health information
  custodian (or trustee) differently. Some include health insurers and government
  agencies; others are limited to direct care providers. Know who qualifies as
  a custodian under each act.

- **Circle of care scope differs.** Most health acts permit implied consent
  within the circle of care, but the definition of who is included varies. Some
  provinces restrict the circle more narrowly than others.

- **Breach notification requirements are not uniform.** Mandatory breach
  notification exists in some provinces (Ontario PHIPA) but not all. Know the
  notification requirements for each applicable jurisdiction.

- **Research use provisions vary.** Each provincial act has different rules for
  research access to PHI. Some require ethics board approval with consent
  waiver; others impose stricter consent requirements.

- **BC, Quebec, and PEI require different analysis.** Without standalone health
  acts, practitioners must apply general privacy legislation. This can result
  in different obligations than provinces with dedicated health statutes.

- **Cross-border transfers create complexity.** When PHI moves between
  provinces, organizations must comply with multiple health privacy regimes.
  There is no harmonized interprovincial framework.

- **Federal institutions remain under Privacy Act.** Federal health-related
  bodies (e.g., Health Canada, Public Health Agency of Canada) are not subject
  to provincial health acts; the federal Privacy Act governs.

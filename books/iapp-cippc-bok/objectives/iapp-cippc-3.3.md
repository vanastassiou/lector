# 3.3: Know how PIPEDA and Privacy Act differ in scope and enforcement

Source: IAPP CIPP/C Body of Knowledge

## Key concepts

- **Fundamental distinction**: PIPEDA and the Privacy Act regulate entirely
  different sectors of Canadian society
  - PIPEDA: Private-sector organizations engaged in commercial activities
  - Privacy Act: Federal government institutions
  - No overlap in coverage; the laws are mutually exclusive in application

- **PIPEDA scope of application**: Governs collection, use, and disclosure of
  personal information in the course of commercial activities
  - Private-sector organizations conducting commercial activity
  - Federally regulated industries (banking, telecommunications, airlines,
    broadcasting, railways) regardless of location
  - Interprovincial and international commercial transactions
  - Does not apply to government institutions or non-commercial activities

- **Privacy Act scope of application**: Governs personal information held by
  federal government institutions
  - Federal departments, agencies, and Crown corporations listed in the
    Schedule to the Act
  - Applies to information collected for program administration, service
    delivery, and internal operations
  - Does not apply to provincial or territorial governments (covered by
    provincial FOIPPAs)
  - Does not apply to private-sector commercial activities

- **Oversight authority**: Both laws are overseen by the Privacy Commissioner of
  Canada, but with different powers
  - Same office handles complaints under both regimes
  - Commissioner's enforcement powers differ significantly between the two laws
  - Federal Court plays different roles under each statute

- **Enforcement model - PIPEDA**: Ombudsman model with enhanced powers
  - Commissioner investigates complaints and issues findings and recommendations
  - After November 2018 amendments, Commissioner can seek binding orders from
    Federal Court for serious violations
  - Compliance agreements available as alternative to court proceedings
  - Mandatory breach notification to Commissioner when real risk of significant
    harm exists
  - No direct fines or penalties under PIPEDA itself (but CASL has separate
    penalties)

- **Enforcement model - Privacy Act**: Pure ombudsman model without order-making
  authority
  - Commissioner investigates complaints and makes recommendations only
  - Recommendations are not binding on government institutions
  - No compliance agreement mechanism
  - No mandatory breach notification provisions in the Act itself (though TBS
    directives require breach reporting)
  - Individual can apply to Federal Court if institution does not comply with
    recommendations

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Applicable law | Enforcement path |
| -------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| Bank refuses customer access to records | PIPEDA | Commissioner investigates; may seek Federal Court order |
| Federal department denies access request | Privacy Act | Commissioner investigates and recommends; individual may apply to Federal Court |
| Private company suffers data breach with risk of harm | PIPEDA | Must notify Commissioner and affected individuals; non-compliance is an offence |
| Federal institution suffers data breach | Privacy Act | TBS directive requires reporting; no statutory breach notification requirement |
| Telecom company misuses customer data | PIPEDA | Commissioner can initiate inquiry or investigate complaint; may seek court orders |
| Canada Revenue Agency discloses taxpayer information improperly | Privacy Act | Commissioner investigates complaint; recommends remedial action |

## Gotchas

- **Same Commissioner, different powers**: A common exam trap assumes the
  Commissioner has identical authority under both laws. Under PIPEDA, the
  Commissioner can seek binding Federal Court orders. Under the Privacy Act,
  the Commissioner can only make non-binding recommendations.

- **Mandatory breach notification**: PIPEDA requires breach notification to the
  Commissioner and affected individuals when there is a real risk of
  significant harm. The Privacy Act has no equivalent statutory requirement -
  breach reporting follows Treasury Board Secretariat directives, not
  legislation.

- **Federal Court role differs**: Under PIPEDA, the Commissioner can apply to
  the Federal Court for orders. Under the Privacy Act, the individual (not the
  Commissioner) must apply to court if the institution fails to act on
  recommendations.

- **No direct fines under either law**: Neither PIPEDA nor the Privacy Act
  imposes direct monetary penalties for privacy violations. PIPEDA creates
  offences for specific violations (e.g., obstruction, retaliation) with fines
  up to $100,000, but these are criminal sanctions, not administrative
  penalties. The Privacy Act has no comparable provisions.

- **Crown corporations can be complex**: Some Crown corporations are listed in
  the Privacy Act Schedule and subject to that law. Others may engage in
  commercial activities subject to PIPEDA. Determining which law applies
  requires checking the Schedule and analyzing the nature of the activity.

- **Provincial government employees**: The Privacy Act does not cover provincial
  or territorial public bodies - these are governed by provincial FOIPPAs. Only
  federal employees working for listed institutions fall under the Privacy Act.

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Privacy Act | PIPEDA | Notes |
| ---- | ----------- | ------ | ----- |
| Entities covered | ~260 federal institutions | Private-sector orgs | Schedule lists covered institutions |
| Commissioner's orders | Non-binding recommendations | Can seek court orders | Key enforcement difference |
| Access request deadline | 30 days | 30 days | Same timeline, different laws |
| Breach notification | Not statutory | Mandatory when RROSH | PIPEDA amended 2018; TBS directive for federal |
| Federal Court application | By individual | By Commissioner | Different standing under each law |
| Offences and penalties | None | Up to $100,000 | PIPEDA s. 28 creates specific offences |
| Compliance agreements | Not available | Available | PIPEDA provides voluntary compliance mechanism |

## Related topics

- **Treasury Board Secretariat directives**: Operational policies that
  supplement the Privacy Act, including breach notification requirements that
  are not in the statute itself
- **Federal Court jurisdiction**: Both laws involve Federal Court review, but
  the paths to court and the available remedies differ significantly
- **Provincial FOIPPA legislation**: Provincial and territorial public-sector
  privacy laws cover provincial governments, municipalities, school boards, and
  health authorities
- **PIPEDA's substantially similar provisions**: Some provinces have
  private-sector laws that apply instead of PIPEDA for local commercial
  activities - a feature with no parallel in the Privacy Act
- **Access to Information Act**: Companion to the Privacy Act for access to
  government records; often administered together by the same officials

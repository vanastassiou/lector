# 2.5: Know that accountability remains with the organization including when using third parties

Source: IAPP CIPP/C Body of Knowledge

## Key concepts

- **Accountability principle**: The first principle of the CSA Model Code and
  PIPEDA Schedule 1. An organization is responsible for personal information
  under its control, including information transferred to third parties for
  processing.
  - Must designate an individual accountable for compliance
  - Accountability cannot be delegated or contracted away
  - Responsibility persists throughout the entire data lifecycle

- **Third-party processors**: External organizations that handle personal
  information on behalf of the collecting organization. Common examples include:
  - Cloud service providers and data hosting
  - Payroll processors and HR service providers
  - Marketing and analytics service providers
  - IT service providers and managed services
  - Call centers and customer service vendors

- **Contractual protections**: Organizations must use contractual means to
  provide comparable levels of protection when transferring information to
  third parties.
  - Written agreements specifying permitted uses and disclosures
  - Required safeguards matching the transferring organization's standards
  - Breach notification obligations
  - Audit and oversight provisions
  - Limitations on subcontracting

- **Due diligence requirements**: Before engaging a third party, organizations
  must assess the processor's ability to protect personal information.
  - Evaluate security controls and practices
  - Review privacy policies and procedures
  - Assess compliance history and reputation
  - Consider jurisdictional factors for cross-border transfers
  - Document the assessment process

- **Ongoing oversight**: Accountability does not end once a contract is signed.
  Organizations must maintain oversight throughout the relationship.
  - Monitor third-party compliance with contractual terms
  - Conduct periodic reviews or audits
  - Respond to incidents involving third-party handling
  - Update agreements as requirements change
  - Terminate relationships when standards are not met

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Outsourcing payroll processing | Contractually require the processor to protect employee information and limit use to payroll purposes | Accountability remains with the employer; processor is an extension of the organization |
| Cloud storage of customer data | Due diligence on provider's security practices plus contractual protections; understand where data is stored | Organization remains accountable regardless of where data is physically located |
| Third party experiences a breach | Original organization must respond as if the breach occurred internally; notify affected individuals | Accountability cannot be transferred to the third party |
| Vendor wants to use data for marketing | Refuse unless explicit consent was obtained from individuals for that purpose | Original consent was for processing only; new uses require new consent |
| Subcontractor hired by primary vendor | Primary organization must ensure contractual chain extends protections to subcontractors | Accountability flows back regardless of how many parties handle the data |
| Third party located in another country | Assess adequacy of protections in that jurisdiction; include contractual safeguards | Cross-border transfer does not eliminate accountability |

## Gotchas

- **Contracts do not transfer accountability**: While contracts create
  obligations for the third party, the original organization remains fully
  accountable to individuals and regulators. A well-drafted contract protects
  the organization through indemnification but does not shift the fundamental
  duty to protect personal information.

- **Breach liability persists**: When a third party suffers a breach involving
  the organization's personal information, the original organization must still
  fulfill breach notification requirements under PIPEDA. The organization cannot
  point to the third party as solely responsible.

- **Consent scope must be respected**: Third parties can only use personal
  information for the purposes the individual consented to. The original
  organization must prevent third parties from using data for their own
  purposes unless separate consent exists.

- **Due diligence is not one-time**: Organizations sometimes conduct due
  diligence before signing a contract but fail to maintain oversight. Ongoing
  monitoring is required to ensure continued compliance.

- **Verbal assurances are insufficient**: Third-party accountability must be
  documented in writing. Contractual protections provide evidence of
  appropriate safeguards and a legal basis for enforcement.

- **Cross-border transfers add complexity**: When personal information is
  transferred to third parties in other countries, the organization must
  consider both Canadian requirements and the legal environment of the
  destination jurisdiction. Accountability remains with the Canadian
  organization regardless of where data is processed.

- **Consumer complaints come to you**: Individuals seeking access to their
  information or complaining about mishandling will approach the original
  organization. The organization cannot redirect them to the third party.

| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| PIPEDA principle number for accountability | Principle 1 | First of the 10 principles in Schedule 1 |
| Requirement for designated individual | Yes | Must designate someone accountable for compliance |
| Can accountability be contracted away | No | Remains with the organization |
| Requirement for comparable protection | Yes | Third parties must provide equivalent safeguards |
| Written contract required | Yes (best practice) | Contractual means to ensure protection |

  establishes organizational responsibility for personal information
- **Safeguards (Principle 7)**: Third parties must implement appropriate
  administrative, technical, and physical safeguards
- **Cross-border data transfers**: International transfers to third parties
  add jurisdictional complexity while accountability remains domestic

  privacy and security practices

  third-party processors, especially for sensitive data or cross-border
  transfers

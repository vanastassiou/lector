# 1.6: Understand Generally Accepted Privacy Principles (GAPP)

Source: IAPP CIPP/C Body of Knowledge

## Key concepts

- **GAPP origin and purpose**: Developed jointly by the American Institute of
  Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and the Chartered Professional
  Accountants of Canada (CPA Canada, formerly CICA) in 2009. Designed as a
  comprehensive privacy framework for organizations to build, assess and certify
  their privacy programs.
  - Created for privacy governance and attestation engagements
  - Enables auditors to assess and report on privacy controls
  - Provides measurable, objective criteria for compliance evaluation

- **GAPP structure**: 10 principles with 77 measurable criteria. Each principle
  contains specific criteria that organizations can implement and auditors can
  verify.
  - Principles provide the conceptual framework
  - Criteria provide implementation specifics and audit checkpoints
  - More detailed than PIPEDA's 10 principles or OECD's 8 guidelines

- **The 10 GAPP principles**:
  - **Management**: Organization defines, documents, communicates and assigns
    accountability for its privacy policies and procedures
  - **Notice**: Organization provides notice about its privacy policies and
    identifies the purposes for which personal information is collected, used,
    retained and disclosed
  - **Choice and consent**: Organization describes choices available to
    individuals and obtains implicit or explicit consent for collection, use and
    disclosure of personal information
  - **Collection**: Organization collects personal information only for the
    purposes identified in the notice
  - **Use, retention and disposal**: Organization limits use of personal
    information to purposes identified in notice and for which consent was
    obtained; retains information only as long as necessary and disposes of it
    in a secure manner
  - **Access**: Organization provides individuals with access to their personal
    information for review and update
  - **Disclosure to third parties**: Organization discloses personal information
    to third parties only for identified purposes and with consent
  - **Security for privacy**: Organization protects personal information against
    unauthorized access
  - **Quality**: Organization maintains accurate, complete and relevant personal
    information for identified purposes
  - **Monitoring and enforcement**: Organization monitors compliance with its
    privacy policies and has procedures to address privacy-related complaints
    and disputes

- **GAPP vs. CSA Model Code/PIPEDA**: Both have 10 principles but serve
  different purposes.
  - GAPP: Governance and attestation framework; 77 criteria; voluntary
  - CSA/PIPEDA: Legal compliance framework; 10 principles; mandatory for
    private sector commercial activities
  - GAPP is more granular with auditable criteria
  - PIPEDA principles are incorporated into binding law

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| External privacy audit for SOC 2 engagement | Apply GAPP framework | GAPP provides measurable criteria suitable for attestation |
| Investor due diligence on privacy practices | Use GAPP assessment | Produces objective, verifiable findings |
| Benchmarking privacy program maturity | GAPP criteria mapping | 77 criteria provide granular measurement |
| Regulatory compliance demonstration | Apply PIPEDA principles | PIPEDA is the binding legal requirement |
| Building internal privacy controls | Use both frameworks | GAPP criteria inform how to implement PIPEDA principles |
| Privacy program gap analysis | GAPP criteria checklist | Identifies specific areas needing improvement |

## Gotchas

- **GAPP is not a legal requirement**: Unlike PIPEDA, GAPP is a voluntary
  framework. Organizations may choose to align with GAPP but cannot be
  penalized by regulators for non-compliance with GAPP specifically.

- **77 criteria, not 77 principles**: GAPP has 10 principles and 77 criteria.
  Exam questions may try to confuse the count. Remember: 10 principles with 77
  supporting criteria.

- **Management is first in GAPP; Accountability is first in CSA/PIPEDA**: The
  first principle differs by name and emphasis. GAPP starts with "Management"
  (organizational governance); CSA/PIPEDA starts with "Accountability"
  (designated individual). Both address organizational responsibility but from
  different angles.

- **GAPP is a joint US-Canadian framework**: Developed by AICPA and CPA Canada
  together. It reflects both countries' privacy traditions and is used in both
  jurisdictions for privacy attestation.

- **GAPP vs. AICPA Trust Services Criteria**: GAPP focuses specifically on
  privacy. AICPA's Trust Services Criteria (used in SOC 2 reports) covers five
  categories: Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality,
  and Privacy. The Privacy category aligns with GAPP.

- **Notice vs. notification**: GAPP's "Notice" principle concerns informing
  individuals about privacy practices before collection. This differs from
  breach "notification" which is about informing individuals after a privacy
  incident.

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| GAPP principles | 10 | Same count as PIPEDA but different framework |
| GAPP criteria | 77 | Measurable implementation checkpoints |
| GAPP effective date | 2009 | Joint AICPA/CPA Canada publication |
| CSA Model Code principles | 10 | Became Schedule 1 of PIPEDA |
| OECD Guidelines principles | 8 | Foundational international framework |
| SOC 2 Trust Services categories | 5 | Privacy is one of the five |

- **CSA Model Code**: Canadian privacy standard with 10 principles; became
  Schedule 1 of PIPEDA; provides the legal framework GAPP complements
- **OECD Guidelines**: Eight foundational privacy principles from 1980;
  influenced both CSA Model Code and GAPP
- **PIPEDA**: Federal private sector law; incorporates CSA principles; GAPP can
  help demonstrate PIPEDA compliance but is not a substitute
- **SOC 2 Privacy**: AICPA attestation engagement that uses GAPP-aligned
  criteria for the privacy trust services category
- **Fair Information Practices (FIPs)**: Original US framework from 1973; the
  conceptual ancestor of OECD Guidelines, CSA Model Code, and GAPP
- **Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs)**: GAPP criteria can inform what to assess
  in a PIA; both are governance tools but serve different purposes

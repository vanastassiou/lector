# 2.2: Understand the scope of application of PIPEDA and substantially similar laws

Source: IAPP CIPP/C Body of Knowledge

## Key concepts

- **PIPEDA's territorial scope**: PIPEDA applies to organizations that collect, use,
  or disclose personal information in the course of commercial activities across
  provincial or national borders, or to federally regulated businesses regardless
  of where they operate.
  - Federal works, undertakings, or businesses (banking, telecommunications,
    interprovincial transportation, broadcasting)
  - Commercial activities crossing provincial or international borders
  - Provinces without substantially similar legislation

- **Substantially similar designation**: The Governor in Council may exempt an
  organization or class of activities from PIPEDA if a province has enacted
  legislation deemed "substantially similar" to the federal law.
  - Provincial law must provide comparable protections
  - Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada provides recommendations
  - Once designated, provincial law applies to intra-provincial commercial
    activities instead of PIPEDA

- **Provinces with substantially similar private-sector laws**:
  - British Columbia: Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA BC) - designated
    January 1, 2004
  - Alberta: Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA Alberta) - designated
    January 1, 2004
  - Quebec: Act Respecting the Protection of Personal Information in the Private
    Sector (Law 25 modernization effective 2023-2024) - designated since 2003

- **When PIPEDA still applies despite provincial law**: Even in provinces with
  substantially similar legislation, PIPEDA continues to apply to:
  - Interprovincial and international commercial transactions
  - Federally regulated employers and their employee information
  - Federal works, undertakings, and businesses (airlines, banks, telecoms,
    railways, broadcasters)
  - Collection, use, or disclosure connected to federal jurisdiction

- **Dual application scenarios**: An organization may need to comply with both
  PIPEDA and provincial law depending on the nature of the activity:
  - Local retail operations follow provincial law
  - Online sales to customers in other provinces trigger PIPEDA
  - A single organization may have different obligations for different activities

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Applicable law | Why |
| -------- | -------------- | --- |
| BC retailer sells only within BC | BC PIPA | Intra-provincial commercial activity in substantially similar province |
| BC retailer sells online nationally | PIPEDA | Interprovincial commercial activity |
| Bank operating in Alberta | PIPEDA | Federally regulated industry regardless of province |
| Quebec employer (non-federal) | Quebec law | Employee information covered by provincial legislation |
| Telecom company in Ontario | PIPEDA | Federally regulated industry |
| Alberta company doing business with US clients | PIPEDA | International commercial activity |
| Ontario retailer (local only) | PIPEDA | Ontario lacks substantially similar private-sector law |

## Gotchas

- **Federal industries always under PIPEDA**: Even if a federally regulated company
  operates entirely within a province with substantially similar legislation,
  PIPEDA applies. The nature of the industry, not the location of activity,
  determines jurisdiction for federal works and undertakings.

- **Provincial law applies to local activities only**: The substantially similar
  exemption covers intra-provincial commercial activities. The moment a transaction
  crosses provincial or national borders, PIPEDA applies.

- **Employee information complexity**: Whether employee information falls under
  PIPEDA or provincial law depends on whether the employer is federally regulated.
  Non-federal employers in BC, Alberta, and Quebec follow provincial rules;
  Ontario employers may follow PIPEDA (though Ontario has no substantially similar
  private-sector law, making this moot for most cases).

- **Not all provinces have substantially similar laws**: Only BC, Alberta, and
  Quebec have private-sector laws deemed substantially similar. In all other
  provinces and territories, PIPEDA applies to all commercial activities, including
  purely local ones.

- **Health-sector overlap**: Some provinces have health-sector privacy laws deemed
  substantially similar. These are separate designations from private-sector laws.
  An organization handling both commercial and health information may face multiple
  regulatory frameworks.

- **Quebec Law 25 modernization**: Quebec's law underwent significant amendments
  effective 2023-2024, strengthening requirements. Organizations operating in
  Quebec must ensure compliance with the updated provisions while the substantially
  similar designation continues.

- **Organizational vs. activity-based analysis**: Determining which law applies
  requires analyzing specific activities, not just organizational characteristics.
  A single organization may be subject to different laws for different activities.

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Provinces with substantially similar private-sector laws | 3 | BC, Alberta, Quebec |
| BC PIPA designation date | January 1, 2004 | Private-sector law |
| Alberta PIPA designation date | January 1, 2004 | Private-sector law |
| Quebec private-sector designation | 2003 | Modernized by Law 25 (2023-2024) |
| Provinces where PIPEDA applies to local commercial activity | 10 | All except BC, AB, QC |
| Federally regulated industries | Always under PIPEDA | Banking, telecom, airlines, etc. |

## Related topics

- **Federally regulated industries**: Banking, interprovincial and international
  transportation, telecommunications, broadcasting - always subject to PIPEDA
- **Provincial private-sector laws**: BC PIPA, Alberta PIPA, Quebec Law 25 - each
  has unique provisions beyond PIPEDA baseline
- **PIPEDA principles**: The 10 principles in Schedule 1 form the baseline that
  provincial laws must match to be deemed substantially similar
- **Health-sector substantially similar laws**: Separate designation process for
  provincial health privacy laws
- **Interprovincial and international commerce**: Cross-border commercial activity
  triggers PIPEDA regardless of substantially similar provincial legislation
- **Governor in Council designation**: The formal process by which provincial laws
  are recognized as substantially similar to PIPEDA

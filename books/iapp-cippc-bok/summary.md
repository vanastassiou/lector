# IAPP CIPP/C Body of Knowledge

IAPP, 2025 (Version 3.1.0, Effective 1 Sept. 2025)

## Core thesis

The CIPP/C certification validates competency in Canadian privacy law across four
sectors: foundational concepts, private sector (PIPEDA), public sector (Privacy
Act), and health sector (provincial health privacy acts). Exam questions assess
both factual knowledge and the ability to apply privacy principles to
organizational decisions.

## Key frameworks

### CIPP/C domain structure

- **Name**: CIPP/C Exam Domain Structure
- **Purpose**: Organize Canadian privacy knowledge into testable competency areas
- **Components**:
  - Domain I: Introduction to Privacy in Canada (25-31 questions)
  - Domain II: Private Sector - PIPEDA and provincial laws (18-22 questions)
  - Domain III: Public Sector - Privacy Act and FOIPPAs (11-15 questions)
  - Domain IV: Health Sector - Provincial health privacy acts (9-13 questions)
- **Application**: Use to prioritize study effort by question weight
  - Domain I carries the highest weight; focus on foundational concepts first
  - Private sector knowledge is second priority

### Bloom's taxonomy for exam questions

- **Name**: Bloom's Taxonomy Question Levels
- **Purpose**: Signal the depth of knowledge required for exam questions
- **Components**:
  - Remember: Define, list, memorize, state facts
  - Understand: Classify, describe, explain, identify, recognize
  - Apply: Execute, implement, solve, use, demonstrate
  - Analyze: Differentiate, compare, contrast, examine, test
  - Evaluate: Appraise, argue, defend, judge, critique
  - Create: Design, develop, formulate, investigate
- **Application**: Match study approach to performance indicator verbs
  - "Understand" questions test comprehension of concepts
  - "Identify" and "Apply" questions require situational judgment

### Fair information practices

- **Name**: Fair Information Practices (FIPs)
- **Purpose**: Foundation for all Canadian privacy legislation
- **Components**:
  - Notice: Inform individuals about data collection
  - Consent: Obtain appropriate authorization
  - Access controls: Limit who can view personal information
  - Accountability: Assign responsibility for compliance
- **Application**: Apply when evaluating any privacy scenario
  - Forms the basis for PIPEDA's 10 principles
  - Referenced across all four exam domains

### CSA Model Code principles

- **Name**: CSA Model Code for the Protection of Personal Information
- **Purpose**: Canadian standard that became the foundation for PIPEDA
- **Components**:
  - Accountability
  - Identifying purposes
  - Consent
  - Limiting collection
  - Limiting use, disclosure, and retention
  - Accuracy
  - Safeguards
  - Openness
  - Individual access
  - Challenging compliance
- **Application**: Use as a checklist for organizational privacy programs
  - Each principle maps to specific PIPEDA requirements

### Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA)

- **Name**: Privacy Impact Assessment
- **Purpose**: Identify and mitigate privacy risks before implementing new
  programs or systems
- **Components**:
  - Scope definition and data flow mapping
  - Risk identification and analysis
  - Mitigation measures
  - PIA report documentation
- **Application**: Required for public sector initiatives
  - Know when to complete a PIA
  - Understand what to include in the PIA report

## Decision heuristics

| When | Do | Because |
| ---- | -- | ------- |
| Determining which law applies to a commercial activity | Check if provincial law is "substantially similar" to PIPEDA | Provincial law applies to intra-provincial commercial activities in AB, BC, QC |
| Handling employee information | Determine if federally or provincially regulated | PIPEDA applies to federally regulated employers; provincial laws may differ |
| Processing health information | Apply provincial health privacy act | Health sector has separate legislation with specific PHI requirements |
| Receiving an access request | Verify identity and respond within legislated timelines | Laws specify response deadlines and identity verification requirements |
| Collecting personal information | Identify and document purposes before collection | Purpose limitation is foundational; cannot expand use without new consent |
| Engaging third parties | Ensure contractual accountability | Organizations remain accountable for information handled by third parties |
| Determining consent type | Match consent form to sensitivity and context | Express consent for sensitive data; implied may suffice for less sensitive |
| Facing a privacy breach | Follow sector-specific notification requirements | Private, public, and health sectors have different breach protocols |
| Evaluating cross-border transfers | Apply relevant law's international transfer provisions | PIPEDA and provincial laws have different mechanisms for cross-border flows |
| Receiving a compliance complaint | Follow established policies and procedures | Proper complaint handling is a specific competency requirement |

## Contrarian or non-obvious claims

- **Personal information definitions vary by jurisdiction and legislation.**
  Employee information, work-related information, public records, and publicly
  available information may or may not qualify as "personal information"
  depending on which law applies.

- **Consent is not always required.** Each sector has specific exceptions where
  collection, use, or disclosure is permitted without consent. Knowing these
  exceptions is as important as knowing consent requirements.

- **Provincial laws can supersede PIPEDA.** When a provincial private sector
  privacy law is deemed "substantially similar," it applies instead of PIPEDA
  for intra-provincial commercial activities.

- **The circle of care concept applies only in health contexts.** Implied
  consent for PHI disclosure operates differently than consent in private or
  public sector contexts.

- **CASL penalties are separate from privacy law penalties.** Canada's
  Anti-Spam Legislation has its own enforcement regime for consent,
  identification, and unsubscribe requirements.

## Practical techniques

### Determining applicable legislation

1. Identify the sector (private, public, or health)
2. Determine if the organization is federally or provincially regulated
3. For private sector: check if provincial "substantially similar" law applies
4. For public sector: determine if federal Privacy Act or provincial FOIPPA
   applies
5. For health sector: identify the applicable provincial health privacy act

### Validating consent

1. Determine the sensitivity of the personal information
2. Match consent form to sensitivity (express vs. implied)
3. Provide clear notice of processing purposes
4. Ensure consent is not a condition of service unless necessary
5. Implement opt-out mechanisms where appropriate
6. Document the consent obtained

### Responding to access requests

1. Verify the requester's identity
2. Acknowledge receipt within legislated timeline
3. Determine what information can be provided or withheld
4. Apply any exemptions (e.g., third-party information, legal privilege)
5. Respond within the statutory deadline
6. Document the response and any exemptions applied

### Managing third-party data handling

1. Establish contractual accountability provisions
2. Define permitted uses and disclosures
3. Require appropriate safeguards (administrative, technical, physical)
4. Specify breach notification obligations
5. Retain oversight responsibility for compliance

### Safeguarding personal information

1. Implement administrative controls (policies, training, access management)
2. Apply technical controls (encryption, access logging, network security)
3. Maintain physical controls (secure storage, facility access, disposal)
4. Consider privacy-enhancing technologies where appropriate
5. Apply safeguards throughout the information lifecycle
6. Extend requirements to third-party processors

## Memorable formulations

- "Competencies are clusters of connected tasks and abilities that constitute a
  broad knowledge domain."
- "Performance Indicators are the discrete tasks and abilities that constitute
  the broader competence group."
- "The verbs that begin the skill and task statements (identify, evaluate,
  implement, define) signal the level of complexity of the exam questions."

# An Introduction to Service Design

Lara Penin, 2018

## Core thesis

Service design is a human-centered, participatory discipline that orchestrates
people, processes, and physical evidence to create valuable experiences over
time. Unlike product design, services are co-produced with users, making the
design of interactions, touchpoints, and backstage operations equally
important. The discipline requires designers to become facilitators,
visualizers, and organizational change agents who work across silos to deliver
holistic service experiences.

## Key frameworks

### Double Diamond Process

- **Name**: Double Diamond Process
- **Purpose**: Structure the messy, iterative nature of design work into
  navigable phases.
- **Components**:
  - Discover: divergent research to understand context and users
  - Define: convergent synthesis to frame the problem
  - Develop: divergent ideation to generate solutions
  - Deliver: convergent implementation and evaluation
- **Application**: Use as a macro-level guide while recognizing that real
  projects iterate between phases.
  - The diamonds emphasize alternating between divergent (expanding
    possibilities) and convergent (narrowing focus) thinking

### Service Blueprint

- **Name**: Service Blueprint
- **Purpose**: Visualize the complete service system showing both customer
  experience and organizational operations.
- **Components**:
  - Customer actions: what the user does
  - Frontstage: visible employee actions and touchpoints
  - Line of visibility: boundary between what customer sees and doesn't see
  - Backstage: invisible employee actions
  - Support processes: internal systems and partners
- **Application**: Map existing services to identify pain points; design new
  services to coordinate all layers.
  - Blueprints originated with Lynn Shostack's 1984 "Designing Services That
    Deliver"
  - Add swim lanes for time, channels, or emotional journey as needed

### Customer Journey Map

- **Name**: Customer Journey Map
- **Purpose**: Document the user's experience across touchpoints and over time.
- **Components**:
  - Stages: phases of the experience (pre-service, service, post-service)
  - Touchpoints: moments of interaction
  - Emotional curve: user's feelings at each stage
  - Pain points and opportunities: where to intervene
- **Application**: Use during research synthesis to identify improvement areas; use during ideation to design new experiences.
  - Journey maps focus on the customer perspective only
  - Combine with blueprints for full system view

### System Map

- **Name**: System Map
- **Purpose**: Visualize the ecosystem of actors, relationships, and flows
  surrounding a service.
- **Components**:
  - Actors: organizations, people, technologies
  - Relationships: connections and dependencies
  - Flows: money, information, materials, influence
- **Application**: Use early in projects to understand stakeholder landscape
  and identify leverage points.
  - Particularly valuable for public sector and multi-stakeholder services

### Business Model Canvas (adapted for services)

- **Name**: Business Model Canvas (adapted for services)
- **Purpose**: Articulate how a service creates, delivers, and captures value.
- **Components**: Nine blocks covering value proposition, customer segments,
  channels, relationships, revenue streams, key resources, activities,
  partners, and cost structure.
- **Application**: Use to evaluate service concepts for viability.
  - Social Business Model Canvas adds social/environmental value dimensions
  - Helps bridge design and business strategy conversations

### RATER Framework (Parasuraman, Zeithaml, Berry)

- **Name**: RATER Framework
- **Purpose**: Evaluate service quality from the customer perspective.
- **Components**:
  - Reliability: delivering promised service dependably
  - Assurance: knowledge and courtesy inspiring trust
  - Tangibles: physical facilities, equipment, appearance
  - Empathy: caring, individualized attention
  - Responsiveness: willingness to help promptly
- **Application**: Use as evaluation criteria for service concepts and existing
  services.

### Theory of Change

- **Name**: Theory of Change
- **Purpose**: Articulate the causal logic connecting interventions to
  outcomes.
- **Components**:
  - Long-term goals
  - Intermediate outcomes
  - Outputs
  - Activities
  - Inputs and assumptions
- **Application**: Use for complex social services where impact is indirect and
  long-term.
  - Maps backward from desired impact to required interventions

## Decision heuristics

| When | Do | Because |
| ---- | -- | ------- |
| Stakeholders have conflicting interests | Map power dynamics explicitly using a stakeholder matrix | Hidden conflicts derail implementation; transparency enables negotiation |
| Users cannot articulate needs | Observe behavior in context rather than rely on interviews | People do not always know or accurately report what they do |
| Service involves emotional labor | Design for employee experience, not just customer experience | Burned-out employees cannot deliver quality service |
| Prototyping a service | Start with low-fidelity roleplay before building anything | Services are performances; you must rehearse the interaction |
| Designing for behavior change | Target moments of transition (moving, new job, having a child) | Habits are more malleable during life changes |
| Evaluating intangible benefits | Use SROI (Social Return on Investment) to monetize social value | Traditional ROI misses most service value |
| Working across organizational silos | Visualize the whole system first to create shared understanding | Silos optimize locally; visualization reveals interdependencies |
| Choosing research methods | Triangulate: combine what people say, do, and make | Each method has blind spots; triangulation improves validity |

## Memorable formulations

- "Services are processes not things--they unfold over time as a series of interactions." (p. 12)
- "The customer is always a co-producer of service value." (p. 38)
- "Design the backstage with as much care as the frontstage." (p. 156)
- "A service is a promise--and the design must deliver on that promise at every touchpoint." (p. 89)
- "Prototyping services means staging rehearsals." (p. 201)
- "The designer's role shifts from author to facilitator." (p. 267)

## Contrarian or non-obvious claims

- **Efficiency can destroy value.** Optimizing individual touchpoints often  degrades overall experience
  - A faster checkout means nothing if the customer could not find what they needed
- **Customer satisfaction is a lagging indicator.** By the time satisfaction drops, the service has already failed multiple times
- **Beautiful touchpoints cannot fix broken systems.** Designing a better app is useless if the underlying service logic is flawed
- **Emotional labor is real labor.** Service workers who must manage their emotions as part of the job experience genuine exhaustion that must be designed for.
- **Co-design is not optional.** Services designed without user participation fail more often, regardless of designer expertise.
- **Physical evidence matters more than expected.** Tangible artifacts (cards, receipts, environments) shape perception of intangible service quality.

## Practical techniques

### Contextual inquiry

- Observe users in their natural environment while they perform tasks.
- Ask them to narrate their actions and reasoning as they work.
- Focus on workarounds and pain points--these reveal unmet needs.
- Document with photos, notes, and sketches rather than video (less intrusive).

### Service safari

- Experience competitor or analogous services as a customer.
- Document touchpoints, emotions, and breakdowns.
- Debrief with team to extract patterns and opportunities.

### Desktop walkthrough

- Build a tabletop model of the service using simple materials (paper, LEGO, figurines).
- Walk stakeholders through scenarios by moving pieces and narrating.
- Identifies gaps and misunderstandings quickly and cheaply.

### Service roleplay prototyping

- Act out the service with team members playing customer and staff roles.
- Use minimal props to simulate touchpoints.
- Iterate the script based on what feels awkward or unclear.
- Record or photograph to capture insights.

### Touchpoint inventory

- List every point where customer interacts with the service.
- Categorize by channel (physical, digital, human).
- Rate each for quality and consistency.
- Prioritize improvement based on frequency and impact.

### Stakeholder mapping

- Identify all actors who influence or are influenced by the service.
- Plot on a matrix by power (high/low) and interest (high/low).
- Develop engagement strategies based on quadrant:
  - High power, high interest: manage closely
  - High power, low interest: keep satisfied
  - Low power, high interest: keep informed
  - Low power, low interest: monitor

### Monetized blueprints

- Add cost and revenue data to service blueprint swim lanes.
- Calculate cost per touchpoint and per customer journey.
- Identify where value is created versus where costs accumulate.
- Use to make business case for service improvements.

### Five core capabilities for service designers

1. **Active and empathic listening**: Hear beyond words to understand context, emotion, and unstated needs.
2. **Process facilitation and stewardship**: Guide groups through complex processes without imposing solutions.
3. **Envisioning and visualizing**: Create representations that make abstract ideas concrete and shareable.
4. **Prototyping and testing**: Build quick, cheap experiments to learn what works.
5. **Organizational change making**: Navigate politics and resistance to implement new services.

# 1.5: Establish and maintain IT risk register integrated with enterprise risk profile

Source: CRISC Exam Study Guide - Hemang Doshi

## Key concepts

- **Risk register**: Centralized inventory of all identified risks consolidating
  risk data for driving risk response and tracking risk status across the
  organization
  - Starts with the risk identification stage
  - Documents risk scenarios with description, category, probability, impact,
    risk score, risk owner, and risk treatment
  - Enables prioritization by providing complete view of all risks (e.g., 100
    low, 50 medium, 20 high risks)
  - Supports decision-making by improving visibility into organizational risk

- **Risk profile**: Overall risk status the organization is exposed to
  - Represents aggregated risk to enterprise (historical and emerging)
  - Must be kept updated with new and emerging risks
  - Enables risk-aware business decisions by management
  - Provides current risk status for the organization

- **Enterprise risk management (ERM)**: Structured practices, methods, and
  processes for managing risks that can adversely impact business objectives
  - Ensures standardized, consistent approach across the organization
  - Without ERM, different departments may use different methodologies
  - Facilitates comparison of risk management results across departments

- **Integration requirement**: Risk register must reflect and update the
  enterprise risk profile
  - Changes in risk profile must be captured in the risk register
  - Risk register provides status of organization's current risk profile
  - Serves as the single source of truth for risk status

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Identify changes in risk profile | Review the risk register | Risk register captures all profile changes and current status |
| Determine current risk status | Use risk register dashboard | Provides complete picture of organization's risk profile |
| New risk identified but not mitigated | Capture in risk register and maintain remediation status | All risks must be documented with their current state |
| Risk is no longer relevant | Remove from risk register | Register should reflect only current, applicable risks |
| Activity triggering new risk initiated | Add new risk to risk register | Capture risks when activities that trigger them begin |
| Newly identified vulnerability | Discuss with owner/security manager, recommend addition to risk register | Proper escalation path ensures documented tracking |

## Gotchas

- **Trap: Risk register captures all risks, not just high risks**: Document all
  identified risks regardless of severity level; prioritization happens after
  capture

- **Trap: Communication plans and industry benchmarks are not risk register
  contents**: Risk register includes scenario, impact, probability, score,
  owner, and treatment - not communication plans or external benchmarks

- **Trap: Primary purpose is driving risk response, not just documentation**:
  While capturing risks is important, the primary purpose is consolidating data
  to drive the risk response plan

- **Trap: Risk register maintenance requires periodic polling**: Centralized
  register with periodic polling from risk assessors keeps it accurate; single
  owner or audit responsibility is insufficient

- **Trap: Risk profile changes trigger register updates, not vice versa**:
  Changes in profile from new tech, business processes, regulations, or market
  conditions should flow into register updates

## Risk register contents

| Field | Purpose |
| ----- | ------- |
| Risk scenario | Description of the risk event |
| Category | Classification of risk type |
| Probability | Likelihood of occurrence |
| Impact | Potential consequences |
| Risk score | Calculated priority level |
| Risk owner | Accountable senior official |
| Risk treatment | Planned or implemented response |
| Corrective actions | Steps taken to address the risk |
| Residual risk | Remaining risk after treatment |

## Risk profile change triggers

| Trigger | Risk register action |
| ------- | -------------------- |
| New technology implementation | Assess and add associated risks |
| Business process changes | Update affected risk scenarios |
| Regulatory requirement changes | Add compliance risks |
| Market demand or customer changes | Update business impact assessments |
| Competitor policy changes | Reassess competitive risks |
| Cascading effects of minor changes | Review interdependencies |

## Related topics

- **Risk ownership**: Risk register documents the owner accountable for each
  risk; mapping risk to business process owners establishes ownership

- **Key risk indicators (KRI)**: Periodic KRI monitoring identifies changes in
  risk profile that require register updates

- **Three lines of defense**: First line (process owners) actively manages risk;
  register integration ensures consistent tracking across all lines

- **Risk response planning**: Risk register drives risk action plans with start
  date, end date, strategy details, and responsible parties

- **Risk prioritization**: Register enables focusing on high-priority risks
  first (concentrate on 20 high risks before 50 medium or 100 low)

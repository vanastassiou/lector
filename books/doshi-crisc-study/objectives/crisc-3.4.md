# 3.4: Establish accountability by assigning control ownership

Source: CRISC Exam Study Guide - Hemang Doshi

## Key concepts

- **Control ownership assignment**: The formal allocation of responsibility for
  specific controls to individuals who ensure their effectiveness and adequacy.
  - Assign to specific individuals, not departments or groups
  - Owner must have authority and experience to select appropriate controls
  - Control ownership is essential for aligning controls with organizational
    goals
  - Without defined ownership, other risk artifacts (treatment plans, registers,
    profiles) will not be accurate or effective

- **RACI model for accountability**: Framework defining four roles in risk and
  control management.
  - Responsible: Performs the actual work to meet stated objectives
  - Accountable: Single person who oversees and manages those responsible;
    liable and answerable for the project
  - Consulted: Provides support and assistance to risk management efforts
  - Informed: Receives status updates and outcomes
  - Effective accountability must be assigned to a specific person, not a group

- **Process owner as control owner**: Business process owners are the natural
  candidates for control ownership within their domains.
  - First line of defense actively manages risk and monitors controls
  - Process owners provide control requirements based on business needs
  - They are responsible for ensuring controls address stakeholder requirements
  - Mapping controls to specific process owners is the best basis for
    establishing ownership

- **Risk owner vs. control owner relationship**: Risk owners select appropriate
  risk responses; control owners ensure controls function effectively.
  - Risk owners are accountable for risks within acceptable levels
  - Control owners monitor and report on control effectiveness
  - Both should be documented in the risk register
  - Results of control monitoring should be communicated to the risk owner

- **Three lines of defense model**: Clarifies essential roles and
  responsibilities for control ownership.
  - First line: Process owners who actively manage risk and monitor controls
  - Second line: Risk management and compliance departments that guide and
    assess
  - Third line: Internal audit that provides independent testing and attestation
  - All three lines must have common goals and planning for effectiveness

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Roles and responsibilities undocumented | Recommend defining accountability for each critical function | Undefined responsibilities are a major risk in attaining objectives |
| Determining who should provide control requirements | Consult process owners | They understand business needs and can specify requirements |
| Identifying who is accountable for IS controls | Resource owner (data owner/system owner) | Owners are ultimately responsible for controls over their resources |
| Aligning controls with organizational goals | Assure ownership of key control activities first | Other control activities cannot be accomplished without defined ownership |
| Control monitoring reveals issues | Report results to risk owner | Risk owner is accountable for maintaining risk within acceptable levels |
| System owner function during accreditation | Select and specify security requirements | System owners determine security requirements for their systems |

## Gotchas

- **Assigning ownership to a department or group**: Allocating accountability to
  a department circumvents ownership. Always assign to a specific individual for
  effective accountability.

- **Confusing accountability with responsibility**: Board of Directors and senior
  management are ultimately accountable for risk policies and standards. Process
  owners are responsible for implementing and monitoring controls.

- **Outsourcing removes accountability**: Outsourcing processes mitigates various
  risks through service providers, but does not reduce or remove the
  organization's accountability for controls.

- **Generic accounts prevent accountability**: Shared or generic accounts impact
  nonrepudiation because no individual user can be held accountable for
  transactions performed under the shared account.

- **Clear accountability is primarily about compliance**: The most important
  reason for creating a clear chain of accountability is assigning risk and
  control ownership appropriately, not compliance or ensuring risk assessment
  is finished on schedule.

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Ultimate accountability for enterprise risk | Board of Directors | Senior management implements; board oversees |
| Accountability for IS resources | Resource owner (data/system owner) | Must ensure relevant controls are in place |
| Control requirement specification | Process owners | Based on business needs and objectives |
| Primary documentation for ownership | Risk register | Contains details of risk, controls, and owners |
| Purpose of audit trail | Establish accountability | Captures who executed transactions and when |

## Related topics

- **Risk register**: Documents both risk ownership and control ownership details,
  including likelihood, impact, priority, mitigation status, and responsible
  parties.

- **Three lines of defense**: Provides the structural framework for assigning
  control responsibilities across operational, risk management, and assurance
  functions.

- **Nonrepudiation**: Requires establishing accountability through mechanisms
  like digital signatures and certificate-based authentication; impossible with
  shared accounts.

- **Segregation of duties**: Related control mechanism that assigns different
  functions to separate individuals, supporting accountability by preventing any
  single person from completing high-risk transactions alone.

- **Control self-assessment**: Process where control owners evaluate their own
  control environment, reinforcing accountability for control effectiveness.

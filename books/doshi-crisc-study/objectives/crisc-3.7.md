# 3.7: Verify risk responses executed per approved action plans

Source: CRISC Exam Study Guide - Hemang Doshi

## Key concepts

- **Risk mitigation plan**: Detailed document containing responsible officer, monitoring process, milestone achievement, and implementation timelines. Review of this plan verifies remediation of control deficiencies.

- **Risk treatment plan**: Structured approach to treating identified risks that includes:
  - Detailed action plan
  - Person responsible for implementation
  - Expected date of completion
  - Start date, end date, strategy details
  - Monitored regularly to track progress

- **Risk action plan**: Documented in risk register once risk response is finalized. Must include start date, end date, responsible person/team, and detailed action plan. Treated as a project with measurable timelines, budget, and milestones.

- **Accountability assignment**: For effective implementation, responsibility must be assigned to specific individuals with deadlines. Risk owner retains ultimate accountability even when management of risk is delegated.

- **Post-implementation review**: Determines efficiency and effectiveness of new controls; verifies system meets requirements, controls are properly deployed, ROI is achieved, and residual risk is within acceptable limits.

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Ensuring vulnerability is addressed | Assign action plans to responsible employee with timelines | Assigned responsibility with deadlines is most effective for timely implementation |
| Verifying control deficiencies remediated | Review risk mitigation plan | Contains responsible officer, monitoring process, milestones, and implementation timelines |
| Ensuring risk kept at acceptable level | Periodic review of controls per risk action plan | Control effectiveness must be verified continuously, not just documented |
| Supporting approved mitigation plan implementation | Assign action plans to individuals with deadlines | Centralized tracking software or root cause analysis alone is insufficient without assigned responsibility |
| New control implemented | Test the control to validate effectiveness | Each new control must be evaluated for additional vulnerabilities and verified to mitigate risk |

## Gotchas

- **Delegation does not transfer accountability**: When local management mitigates risk owned by corporate management, corporate management remains responsible for monitoring and controlling the risk.

- **Documentation alone is insufficient**: Merely documenting risks in a register does not ensure they are addressed. Active periodic review of controls against the action plan is required.

- **Milestones without ownership fail**: Action plan monitoring software is ineffective without first assigning responsibility to specific individuals with deadlines.

- **Post-implementation review timing**: Must be conducted after sufficient time to determine effectiveness, efficiency, and adequacy - not immediately after deployment.

- **Incidents vs. risks**: Already-occurred incidents (realized risks) are not in scope of risk treatment plans. This is an area of major concern if overlooked.

- **Critical path monitoring**: Delays in critical path elements increase overall project risk. Risk action plans should be monitored as projects.

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Risk treatment plan scope | Risks exceeding tolerance level | Not required for accepted, avoided, or transferred risks |
| Control review frequency | Periodic intervals | Ensures risk remains at acceptable level |
| Post-implementation participants | Development team, end users, risk practitioner | Joint review required |
| Project closeout accountability | Specific individuals for outstanding issues | Must include follow-up and closure responsibility |

## Related topics

- **Risk register**: Documents risk ownership, corrective actions, residual risk, and remediation status. Provides centralized view for tracking and verification.
- **Control testing**: Best method to verify control effectiveness. Role of risk practitioner is to assist in planning, reporting, and scheduling tests.
- **KRI monitoring**: Periodic monitoring identifies changes in risk profile; determines if additional response is required.
- **Exception management**: Exceptions to policy require documented escalation process and validation before reporting.
- **Project closeout**: Must include accountability assignment for outstanding issues, risk register updates, documentation archival, post-implementation review, and end-user sign-off.

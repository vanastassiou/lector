# 2.5: Create and maintain IT risk register with recognized risk scenarios

Source: CRISC Exam Study Guide - Hemang Doshi

## Key concepts

- **Risk register**: Centralized inventory that consolidates all identified risks
  in one place for driving risk response and tracking risk status across the
  organization
  - Maintenance process starts during risk identification phase
  - Primary purpose is to drive risk response planning, not just documentation
  - Enables prioritization by providing a complete view of organizational risk

- **Risk scenario**: Visualization of a possible event that can adversely impact
  business objectives
  - Based on identified risks and potential threats to business assets
  - Helps estimate frequency and impact of risk events
  - Most effective technique for assessing business risk

- **Risk scenario components**:
  - Agent: Element that generates the threat (internal or external)
  - Threat type: Natural, system failure, external attack, accidental
  - Event: Nature of incident (data leakage, system down, theft)
  - Asset: What is impacted (IT infrastructure, reputation, data)
  - Time: Temporal impact (immediate vs. long-term effects)

- **Risk register contents**: Each entry should include:
  - Risk scenario with description
  - Category
  - Probability
  - Impact
  - Risk score
  - Risk owner
  - Risk treatment

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Risk identified but not yet mitigated | Capture in risk register and track remediation status | All risks must be documented regardless of mitigation state |
| Determining changes in risk profile | Review the risk register | Register provides current status of organizational risk profile |
| Ensuring register accuracy over time | Publish centralized register with periodic polling for risk assessors | Enables identification of new and emerging risks |
| Developing risk scenarios | Combine top-down and bottom-up approaches | Complementary methods: top-down addresses business objectives, bottom-up addresses process-level risks |
| New risk needs to be added | Add when the activity that triggers the risk is initiated | Proactive registration before risk materializes |
| Risk should be removed | Remove when risk is no longer relevant | Keeps register current and actionable |

## Gotchas

- **Register purpose misconception**: Primary objective is driving risk
  response, not merely documenting or capturing risks; documentation is a
  secondary aspect

- **Scenario development approach**: Neither top-down nor bottom-up alone is
  sufficient; the combination provides comprehensive coverage of strategic and
  operational risks

- **Register maintenance ownership**: Should not be outsourced or delegated
  solely to audit personnel; risk assessors across the organization must
  participate through periodic polling

- **Top-down focus**: In top-down scenario development, business objectives are
  the most important factor to identify, not IT infrastructure or critical
  processes

- **Scenario value**: Risk scenarios help estimate frequency and impact of
  risk; they do not minimize risk response efforts or guarantee all risks are
  identified

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Register initiation | Risk identification phase | Must begin during identification, not later phases |
| Risk owner requirement | Senior official | Must have authority to make risk management decisions |
| Scenario data source | Potential threats in register | Most important information for developing scenarios |
| Bias prevention method | Representative and historical data | Ensures objectivity in scenario development |
| First step in scenario identification | Identify risk factors | Before developing detailed scenarios |

- Risk identification: Feeds the risk register with initial entries and
  potential threats
- Risk prioritization: Register enables ranking of high, medium, and low risks
  for resource allocation
- Risk profile: Register reflects and tracks changes in organizational risk
  posture
- Risk ownership: Each risk in the register must have an assigned accountable
  owner
- Risk response planning: Register's primary purpose is to drive response
  actions

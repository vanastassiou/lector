# 3.10: Report IT risk profile changes and trends to management

Source: CRISC Exam Study Guide - Hemang Doshi

## Key concepts

- **Risk profile**: Overall risk status that the organization is exposed to;
  aggregates historical risk and emerging risk into a single view
  - Must be kept updated with new and emerging risks
  - Enables risk-aware business decisions by management
  - Changes should be recorded in the risk register

- **Risk register as source of truth**: Primary document for identifying changes
  in an organization's risk profile
  - Should provide current risk profile status
  - Updated when risk profile changes occur

- **Purpose of reporting changes**: Significant changes reported to senior
  management to:
  - Update management about current risk profile
  - Enable educated decision-making
  - Determine whether additional response is required

- **Key risk indicators (KRIs)**: Most useful data for communicating current
  state of risk to management
  - Periodic monitoring identifies changes in risk profile
  - Results placed before senior management at regular intervals
  - When KRI reaches threshold, first reported to business process owner

- **Lead vs lag indicators**:
  - Lead indicators: Forward-looking; provide warning signals for emerging risk
  - Lag indicators: Backward-looking; provide relevant trends and historical
    data to improve risk response

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Present current risk profile to senior management | Use risk register dashboard | Provides complete picture of organization's risk profile |
| Report risk to top management | Use dashboard | High-level overview easily tailored to senior management needs |
| Identify changes in risk profile | Review risk register | Risk register tracks profile changes and current status |
| Evaluate current risk profile after year-long gap | Conduct new risk assessment by independent expert | Identifies new or emerging risks that existing controls may not address |
| KRI reaches threshold | Report to business process owner first | Owner determines risk response and evaluates control effectiveness |

## Gotchas

- **Reporting purpose misconception**: Main reason to report risk profile
  changes is NOT to update inventory, budget, or individual risk
  probability/impact--it is to update management about current overall risk
  profile

- **KRI monitoring objective**: Prime objective is to monitor change in risk
  profile, not to minimize cost or error rates

- **Dashboard vs other tools**: Work breakdown reports and Gantt charts are
  project management tools; balance scorecards monitor IT performance--neither
  is suitable for risk reporting to management

- **Report content driver**: Risk reports should be tailored to the target
  audience, not to risk severity or vulnerability counts

- **Independent review requirement**: KRI monitoring by line managers should be
  validated through independent review of reported results

## Factors driving risk profile changes

| Factor | Notes |
| ------ | ----- |
| New technologies | Implementation introduces new threat vectors |
| Business process changes | Alter risk exposure and control requirements |
| Regulatory requirements | Create new compliance obligations |
| Market demand and customer requirements | Shift operational priorities |
| Competitor policies | Industry changes affect risk landscape |
| Cascading effects | Minor changes may compound into significant impact |

## Reporting formats

| Format | Best use |
| ------ | -------- |
| Dashboard | Senior management reporting; high-level overview |
| Risk register dashboard | Presenting current risk profile; complete picture |
| Heat maps | Visual risk severity representation |
| Scorecards | Performance tracking |
| KRI reports | Current state of risk; control effectiveness |

## Related topics

- **Risk appetite and tolerance**: Basis for developing KRIs includes
  organization's risk appetite, metrics, and current risk profile
- **Risk monitoring**: Closely associated with risk reporting; results of
  monitoring feed into reports
- **Continuous monitoring**: Used for high-risk areas where impact and
  frequency of occurrence are high; first step is identifying high-risk areas
- **Control assessment**: Effectiveness depends on accurate data, timely
  reporting to management, and skilled risk practitioners

# 1.6: Facilitate identification of risk appetite and tolerance by key stakeholders

Source: CRISC Exam Study Guide (Hemang Doshi)

## Key concepts

- **Risk capacity**: Maximum risk an organization can afford to take. Represents
  the absolute upper limit based on available resources and constraints.
  - Always greater than both risk tolerance and risk appetite
  - Example: Total savings of $1000 available for investment

- **Risk appetite**: Amount of risk an organization is willing to take.
  - Reflects management's predisposition toward risk taking
  - Differs by organization: risk-prone organizations have high appetite;
    risk-averse organizations have low appetite
  - Determined by organizational culture and inclination toward risk taking
  - Example: Willingness to invest $700 of available $1000

- **Risk tolerance**: Acceptable deviation from risk appetite.
  - Always lower than risk capacity
  - Can be equal to or greater than appetite
  - Represents permissible flexibility around stated appetite
  - Example: Willing to stretch investment to $750 if conditions favor it

- **Relationship hierarchy**: Risk Capacity > Risk Tolerance >= Risk Appetite
  - Risk acceptance should stay within risk appetite
  - Risk acceptance must never exceed risk capacity

## Stakeholder responsibilities

- **Senior management**: Accountable for approving risk appetite and tolerance
  related to information security. Must define and formally approve both values.

- **Risk owners (business process owners)**: Responsible for monitoring that
  risk stays within tolerance levels. First line of defense in managing risks.

- **Risk practitioners**: Facilitate identification by understanding business
  processes, data flows, decision-making processes, and organizational culture.
  Design controls based on appetite and tolerance levels.

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Aligning appetite with business objectives | Direct resources toward areas of low risk tolerance | Critical processes need more controls; ensures appropriate resource allocation |
| Determining compliance with risk appetite | Evaluate whether residual risk is within acceptable risk level | Residual risk within appetite = compliant |
| Setting appetite for new initiative | Assess organizational culture and predisposition toward risk taking | Culture is the primary driver of appetite |
| Reviewing existing appetite levels | Reassess when technology, structure, or strategy changes | External factors may invalidate prior assumptions |

## Gotchas

- **Trap: Confusing tolerance with appetite**: Tolerance is the deviation
  allowed from appetite, not a synonym for it. Exam questions test this
  distinction.

- **Trap: Assuming appetite is static**: Risk appetite and tolerance require
  periodic review. New technology, organizational restructuring, or strategy
  changes trigger reassessment.

- **Trap: Ignoring culture**: The most important factor determining risk
  appetite is organizational culture and predisposition toward risk taking, not
  technical factors or external benchmarks.

- **Trap: Believing any stakeholder can set appetite**: Only senior management
  has authority to approve risk appetite and tolerance. Risk practitioners
  facilitate but do not decide.

## Benefits of defining capacity, appetite, and tolerance

- Provides evidence of risk-based decision-making processes
- Helps understand how each component of the enterprise contributes to overall
  risk profile
- Enables prioritization and approval of risk response
- Identifies specific areas where risk response is warranted
- Risks with low appetite are addressed immediately

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Approval authority | Senior management | Must formally define and approve |
| Review trigger | Technology, restructuring, strategy changes | Reassess risk portfolio when these occur |
| Compliance measure | Residual risk vs acceptable risk | Residual risk within appetite = compliant |

## Related topics

- **Risk culture**: Organizational values and attitudes toward risk that drive
  appetite determination. Poor risk culture shows gaps between documented
  appetite and actual behavior.

- **Three lines of defense**: Business process owners (first line) keep risk
  within appetite; risk and compliance functions (second line) provide
  oversight.

- **Key Risk Indicators (KRI)**: Thresholds should align with risk appetite and
  tolerance. KRIs validate that appetite levels remain appropriate.

- **Residual risk**: The measure used to determine compliance with appetite.
  Successful risk management keeps residual risk within appetite.

- **Risk response prioritization**: Appetite and tolerance are deciding factors
  for which risks to address first and how to allocate resources.

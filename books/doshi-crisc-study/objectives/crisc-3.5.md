# 3.5: Support control owners in establishing procedures and documentation

Source: CRISC Exam Study Guide - Hemang Doshi

## Key concepts

- **Control owner**: The first line of defense responsible for implementing and
  maintaining controls within their business unit. Typically the business
  process owner who manages daily operational activities and monitors control
  effectiveness on an ongoing basis.

- **Policies**: High-level statements of management direction. Approved by
  senior management or board of directors. Changed infrequently.

- **Standards**: Mandatory requirements that support policy compliance.
  Dynamic documents updated when control objectives are not achieved or based
  on risk assessment results. Provide detailed direction to comply with policy.

- **Procedures**: Detailed steps and actions that support policies and
  standards. Changed more frequently than policies or standards. Operational
  in nature.

- **Guidelines**: Support procedure implementation with examples, suggestions,
  and execution details.

- **Three lines of defense model**:
  - First line: Process owners who implement controls and monitor effectiveness
  - Second line: Risk and compliance functions that develop framework,
    policies, standards, and procedures
  - Third line: Audit function providing independent assurance

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Control owner needs exception to policy | Documented formal escalation process | Exceptions allowed only when risk is justified by benefit; prevents ad-hoc judgments |
| Process owner updating control procedures | Review at periodic intervals | Address new and emerging risks; maintain version history |
| New control implementation | Sign-off from system/process owner | Validates effectiveness before deployment |
| Security exception identified | Validate first | Rules out false positives before escalating |
| Multiple departments need same control | Align procedures with corporate policy | Prevents conflicting or overlapping procedures |

## Gotchas

- **Exception management is not based on judgment**: Exceptions require a
  documented escalation process, not approval by process owner or manager
  alone.

- **Procedures link to policies through standards**: Standards provide the
  minimum requirements; procedures detail how to meet those requirements.

- **First line conducts control adequacy review**: Process owners, not audit or
  risk management, are responsible for reviewing control environment adequacy.

- **Document currency matters**: The last review date confirms the documents
  meet current business environment. Version history must be maintained.

- **Third-party applicability**: Policies, standards, procedures, and
  guidelines must extend to third-party vendors and service providers.

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Document hierarchy | Policy > Standard > Procedure > Guideline | Decreasing formality, increasing detail |
| Change frequency | Procedures > Standards > Policies | Procedures change most frequently |
| Exception approval | Policy approver | Not process owner or risk practitioner |
| Control sign-off | System/process owner | Required before implementation |

## Related topics

- **Change management**: Structured process for implementing control changes;
  preventive control requiring formal approval, documentation, and testing

- **Configuration management**: Most susceptible to introducing vulnerabilities
  through misconfigurations and missing updates

- **Issue and finding management**: Procedures stipulate timelines for
  addressing issues; priority given to high-risk issues; root cause analysis
  prevents recurrence

- **Control monitoring**: Risk practitioner assists in planning, reporting, and
  scheduling tests; monitoring results discussed with risk owner (business
  process owner)

- **Control self-assessment (CSA)**: Process owners conduct self-assessment as
  part of control monitoring alongside periodic testing

## Exam focus

| Question pattern | Key answer |
| ---------------- | ---------- |
| Who should approve policy exceptions? | The policy approver |
| Best approach for exception management? | Documented escalation process |
| First step when exception noted? | Validate to rule out false positive |
| Which document has high-level management direction? | Policy |
| Example of management control? | Policies and procedures |
| Primary concern with inadequate data/system ownership procedures? | Users may have unauthorized access to create, modify, or delete data |
| Who reviews control environment adequacy? | First line of defense (process owners) |

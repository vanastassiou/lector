# 2.3: Develop IT risk scenarios based on available data

Source: CRISC Exam Study Guide - Hemang Doshi

## Key concepts

- **Risk scenario**: A visualization of a possible event that can have adverse
  impact on business objectives. Used to imagine what could go wrong and
  identify hurdles to achieving business goals.
  - Must be based on identified risks from the risk register
  - Developed from potential threats to business assets
  - Examples: network unavailability, system downtime, database breach

- **Risk scenario components**: Five elements that define a complete IT risk
  scenario:
  - Agent: Element generating the threat (internal or external)
  - Threat type: Nature of threat (natural, system failure, external attack,
    accidental)
  - Event: Incident type (data leakage, system down, theft)
  - Asset: What is impacted (IT infrastructure, reputation, data)
  - Time: Temporal impact (immediate vs. long-term effects)

- **Top-down approach**: Risk events identified from senior management
  perspective by starting with business objectives.
  - Addresses risks that directly impact business goals
  - Covers both IT and non-IT risk events
  - Easier to obtain management buy-in

- **Bottom-up approach**: Risk events identified from process owner/employee
  perspective by examining job functions in specific processes.
  - Addresses process-level operational risks
  - Captures risks visible only at execution level

- **Best approach**: Combine both top-down and bottom-up approaches. They are
  complementary and should be used simultaneously.

## Data sources for scenario development

- **Risk register**: Primary source containing potential threats. The most
  important information for developing scenarios is the documented potential
  threats.
- **Historical data**: Past incidents provide basis for scenarios. Using
  representative and historical data is the most effective method to avoid
  bias.
- **Emerging risks**: New and evolving threats beyond past incidents

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Developing scenarios for strategic risks | Top-down approach | Aligns with business objectives and senior management goals |
| Developing scenarios for operational risks | Bottom-up approach | Process owners understand execution-level risks |
| Comprehensive risk assessment | Combined approach | Top-down addresses objectives; bottom-up addresses process-level risks |
| Ensuring unbiased scenarios | Use representative and historical data | Reduces subjectivity in probability estimates |
| Estimating likelihood of events | Use risk scenarios | Scenario analysis examines possible futures and probabilities |

## Gotchas

- **Trap: Top-down OR bottom-up**: Always combine both approaches. Neither is
  sufficient alone. Exam may present options favoring one approach - choose the
  combination.

- **Trap: Incident analysis as most effective**: Risk scenarios are the most
  effective technique for risk assessment. Incident analysis only addresses
  historical events, not emerging risks.

- **Trap: Risk scenarios minimize response efforts**: Scenarios help estimate
  frequency and impact - they do not minimize response efforts.

- **Trap: Scenarios address all potential risks**: Scenarios help identify and
  analyze risks but do not guarantee all risks are captured.

- **First step confusion**: The first step in identification of risk scenarios
  is to identify the risk factors, not to create scenarios directly.

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Primary purpose of scenarios | Estimate frequency and impact | Enables risk assessment process |
| Most effective assessment technique | Risk scenarios | Over risk-based audit, incident analysis, or response plans |
| Key risk register input | Potential threats | Not risk owner, response plan, or reported incidents |
| Scenario development approach | Combined top-down and bottom-up | Complementary methods |

## Benefits of risk scenarios

- Easiest and most effective way to explain risk to business process owners
- Involvement of process owners makes information gathering more relevant
- Helps identify risks aligned with business objectives
- Used in threat and vulnerability assessments to estimate likelihood and
  impact

  scenarios are documented back into the register with probability and impact
- **Threat modeling (2.3)**: Threat-based approach identifies risks by
  understanding attack methods, motivations, and techniques
- **Risk assessment techniques (2.6)**: Scenarios feed into qualitative and
  quantitative analysis
- **Qualitative risk assessment**: Uses different scenarios with threats and
  impacts for comprehensive outcome

# 3.11: Facilitate identification of KPIs for control performance assessment

Source: CRISC Exam Study Guide - Hemang Doshi

## Key concepts

- **Key Performance Indicator (KPI)**: Indicator that measures how well a process
  is doing in terms of its goals and objectives
  - Provides warning when values approach or exceed thresholds
  - Used in combination with KRIs and KCIs to measure performance and mitigate
    risk
  - Senior management is predominantly interested in KPIs

- **Key Control Indicator (KCI)**: Indicator that measures the effectiveness of
  controls
  - Also called control effectiveness indicators
  - Provides insight into ongoing adequacy of a control to keep risk at
    acceptable levels
  - Tolerance levels are designed considering criticality of assets the control
    protects
  - KCI and KRI are inversely correlated: effective controls mean risk stays
    within limits

- **Threshold**: Minimum requirements or maximum limit within which KPI, KRI,
  and KCI are expected to operate
  - Values within threshold indicate acceptable performance
  - Values outside threshold require immediate attention

- **SMART characteristics**: Criteria for effective metrics
  - Specific: clear, concise, easily understandable
  - Measurable: quantifiable without subjectivity
  - Attainable: realistic and achievable
  - Relevant: aligned with organizational goals and objectives
  - Time-bound: achievable in a given timeframe

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Evaluating disaster recovery readiness | Results of tests and exercises | Demonstrates actual capability, not just documentation |
| Measuring control management effectiveness | Measure control effectiveness against business objectives | Shows whether controls achieve intended purpose |
| Assessing processing environment | User satisfaction survey | Indicates how well operations meet user expectations |
| Monitoring user access administration | Percent of accounts complied with configuration | Reflects overall impact of access controls |
| Validating control effectiveness | Key Control Indicator (KCI) | Specifically designed to measure control performance |

## Gotchas

- **KPI vs KCI confusion**: KPIs measure business performance targets; KCIs
  measure control effectiveness. Many organizations incorrectly label everything
  as "KPI"

- **Threshold interpretation**: A KPI requires immediate attention when its
  value is outside the threshold, not when fluctuating or below average

- **Metric recipient relevance**: The most important criterion for metric
  effectiveness is that it is meaningful to the recipient. Completeness,
  accuracy, and cost-effectiveness are secondary

- **Lead vs lag indicators**: Lead indicators provide forward-looking warning
  signals; lag indicators show historical trends. Both are needed for effective
  risk response

- **KCI-KRI relationship**: KCI acts as a leading indicator for associated KRIs.
  A single control may affect multiple risk areas, so KCI may have broader
  implications than KRIs

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Error rate threshold example | 10% | Above threshold requires escalation |
| System uptime target example | >99% | KPI for availability |
| Tolerance definition timing | Before KCI creation | Tolerances must be established first |

## KPI examples by domain

| Domain | KPI example |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Availability | Network uptime percentage |
| Disaster recovery | Results of tests and exercises |
| Operations | User satisfaction survey results |
| Access management | Percent of accounts compliant with configuration |

## KCI examples

- Percentage of phishing emails blocked by filtering software
- Percentage of audit findings closed within specified time
- Instances of malicious traffic bypassing the firewall

## Related topics

- **Key Risk Indicators (KRI)**: Measures level of risk; threshold should align
  with risk appetite and tolerance
- **Control monitoring**: Ongoing validation that controls address risk; more
  effective than ad-hoc control testing
- **Dashboard reporting**: Most effective method for reporting metrics to senior
  management
- **Optimum control level**: Balance between control effectiveness and cost of
  maintaining the control

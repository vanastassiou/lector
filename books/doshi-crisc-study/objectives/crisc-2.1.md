# 2.1: Collect and analyze documentation about internal and external environments

Source: CRISC Exam Study Guide - Hemang Doshi

## Key concepts

- **Documentation review purpose**: The primary reason for reviewing documentation before starting a risk assessment is to understand current business processes, objectives, and environment. Risk assessment is effective only when the assessor understands the organization's context.

- **First step in risk identification**: Gathering information about current and future business environment is the initial step in any risk identification process. This precedes determining threats, vulnerabilities, or risk appetite.

- **Business process review objectives**:
  - Identify issues with current processes
  - Gather information for process improvement
  - Review and monitor project progress and milestones

- **Business process owners**: Best source for feedback about IT system effectiveness. They understand system functionalities and linkage to business objectives, and provide unbiased viewpoints.

- **Organizational assets**: Risk management protects both tangible and intangible assets:
  - People (key employee risk, succession planning)
  - Technology (outdated systems, patching vulnerabilities)
  - Data (sensitive vs. critical, protection at rest and in transit)
  - Intellectual property (trademarks, patents, trade secrets)
  - Business processes (flexibility, currency)

- **Asset valuation factors**:
  - Reputational loss and legal penalties
  - Impact on third parties and business partners
  - Business continuity impact
  - Monetary loss and breach of contracts
  - Loss of competitive advantage
  - Legal costs

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| External team begins risk assessment | Review documentation first to understand business processes | Assessment is ineffective without understanding business context |
| Determining IT system support of objectives | Interview business process owners | They understand system-to-objective linkage and provide unbiased feedback |
| New law impacts security requirements | Analyze which systems and processes are affected | Must determine if existing controls already address new requirements |
| Changes in organization's risk profile | Review risk register | Risk registers document all identified risks and profile changes |
| Understanding compliance impact on objectives | Compliance-oriented BIA | Identifies all compliance requirements and their business impact |
| Third-party outsourcing to foreign country | Consider laws and regulations first | Origin country laws may not be enforceable abroad |

## Gotchas

- **Documentation review vs. gap analysis**: Documentation review aims to understand business processes, not to identify documentation gaps. The purpose is context, not completeness assessment.

- **Internal audit reports vs. risk register**: For tracking risk profile changes, use the risk register rather than internal audit reports. Audit reports are point-in-time; risk registers maintain ongoing risk status.

- **Previous audit reports as first step**: Reviewing previous audit reports is not the first step in risk identification. Gathering current and future environment information comes first.

- **Fresh risk assessment trigger**: Changes in business environment trigger fresh risk assessments, not purchases of new assets, information classification changes, or procedure updates.

- **Senior management accountability**: Accountability for IT system risk resides with senior management, not IT department, end users, or risk management department. Others support implementation.

## Internal environment documentation

| Document type | Purpose | Key review points |
| ------------- | ------- | ----------------- |
| Policies | High-level management direction | Alignment with business objectives, approval authority |
| Standards | Mandatory requirements for policy compliance | Currency, control objective achievement |
| Procedures | Detailed steps supporting policies | Frequency of updates, operational relevance |
| Guidelines | Implementation details and examples | Practical applicability |
| Risk register | Document all identified risks | Risk owner, probability, impact, current status |
| Data classification policy | Define protection levels by asset class | Categories, protection requirements, roles |
| Data retention policy | Define retention periods | Business requirements, legal/contractual requirements |

## External environment considerations

| Factor | Risk consideration |
| ------ | ------------------ |
| Laws and regulations | Compliance requirements, enforceability across jurisdictions |
| Contractual requirements | Third-party obligations, SLA terms |
| Industry standards | Benchmarking, peer practices |
| Threat landscape | External threat sources, emerging threats |
| Technology changes | Obsolescence risk, new vulnerabilities |
| Market conditions | Business process flexibility requirements |

## Information gathering methods

- **Delphi technique**: Allows anonymous risk identification through multiple questionnaire rounds with expert consensus building
- **Brainstorming/structured interviews**: Gather information through meetings with individuals or small groups
- **Checklists**: Predefined lists of potential threats using previous lists, codes, or standards
- **Business impact analysis (BIA)**: Determines critical processes and recovery strategies
- **Compliance-oriented BIA**: Identifies compliance requirements and their impact on objectives

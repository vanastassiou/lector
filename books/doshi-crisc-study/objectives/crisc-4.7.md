# 4.7: Information security frameworks and standards

Source: CRISC Exam Study Guide - Hemang Doshi

## Key concepts

- **Control framework**: A structured set of guidelines for designing,
  implementing, and monitoring controls. Provides a baseline for evaluating
  control adequacy and effectiveness.
  - Primary basis for selecting security technology is ability to mitigate risk
    to enterprise's goals, not compliance with international certifications
  - Control frameworks should address defined control objectives before
    implementation

- **IT governance (EGIT)**: Process to monitor and control IT activities,
  ensuring IT provides value to business and risks are appropriately addressed.
  - Primarily the responsibility of the Board of Directors
  - Main objective: optimal use of technology resources
  - Effectiveness determined by ensuring involvement of all stakeholders
  - IT plan should be consistent with organization's business plan

- **Third-party assurance**: Certification or attestation for compliance with
  industry-recognized standards, provided by independent third parties.
  - Helps earn confidence of shareholders, customers, and stakeholders
  - Cloud service providers commonly seek third-party assurance

- **Security architecture**: Provides overview and relationship between systems.
  - Primary purpose: align security strategy between functional areas of
    organization and external parties
  - Most useful for managing complex security deployments

## Widely recognized standards and frameworks

| Framework | Purpose |
| --------- | ------- |
| ISO 27001 | Information security management system (ISMS) certification |
| PCI DSS | Payment card industry data security standard |
| COBIT 5 | IT governance and management framework |
| SSAE 16 | Attestation standard for service organizations |
| TOGAF | Enterprise architecture framework |
| Zachman | Enterprise architecture classification schema |
| DODAF | Department of Defense architecture framework |
| FEAF | Federal enterprise architecture framework |

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Ensuring service provider complies with security requirements | Conduct periodic audit | Verifies actual compliance with agreement requirements |
| Determining if security framework meets organization's needs | Conduct process assessment | Evaluates framework suitability against current processes |
| Managing complex security deployments | Develop security architecture | Provides overview and relationship between systems |
| Evaluating IT equipment supplier value | Comparative analysis of cost and performance | Enables objective assessment against alternatives |
| Addressing audit findings | Create risk mitigation plan | Takes corrective action to close findings |

## Gotchas

- **Framework selection vs. technology selection**: Selecting security
  technology should be based on ability to mitigate risk to enterprise goals,
  not compliance with frameworks alone.

- **IT governance ownership**: IT governance is the responsibility of the Board
  of Directors, not IT management or the CIO.

- **Information security policy review**: Senior management must review
  information security policy. Lack of senior management review is a critical
  weakness in the governance model.

- **Stakeholder involvement**: Effectiveness of IT governance implementation is
  determined by stakeholder involvement, not just management approval.

- **Control framework vs. risk register**: A control framework provides the
  structure for control design, while a risk register documents identified
  risks. Both are needed but serve different purposes.

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Information security policy review | At least annually | Address new and emerging risks |
| IT risk management program scope | Critical functions minimum | Need not cover all functions |
| Continuous monitoring deployment | High-risk areas | Where incidents have high impact and frequency |

## Related topics

- **Control categories**: Preventive, detective, corrective, deterrent,
  directive, and compensating controls work within the framework structure
- **Administrative, technical, and physical controls**: Three-layer control
  classification aligned with framework requirements
- **Enterprise risk management (ERM)**: Overarching risk management approach
  that frameworks support
- **Policies, standards, and procedures**: Hierarchy linking governance
  intentions to operational controls
  - Standards are minimum requirements to comply with security policy
  - Procedures link to security policy through standards
- **Third-party risk management**: Frameworks provide basis for evaluating
  vendor compliance

# 3.6: Update risk register to reflect changes in risk profile

Source: CRISC Exam Study Guide - Hemang Doshi

## Key concepts

- **Risk register**: Centralized inventory of all identified organizational
  risks. Consolidates risk data for driving risk response and tracking risk
  status across the enterprise.
  - Contains: risk scenarios, description, category, probability, impact, risk
    score, risk owner, and risk treatment status
  - Primary purpose: drive the risk response plan, not merely document risks
  - Starts with risk identification and continues through the risk lifecycle

- **Risk profile**: Aggregated view of the organization's overall risk
  exposure, including historical and emerging risks.
  - Provides current risk status for management decision-making
  - Enables risk-aware business decisions when kept current
  - Changes trigger evaluation of whether additional response is required

- **Factors that change risk profile**:
  - Implementation of new technologies
  - Changes in business processes
  - Changes in regulatory requirements
  - Changes in market demand and customer requirements
  - Changes in competitor policies
  - Cascading effects of minor changes

- **Periodic review requirement**: Risk practitioners must evaluate the
  organization's risk profile at regular intervals to identify changes and
  determine if additional response is needed.

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Identifying changes in organization's risk profile | Review the risk register | Risk register provides status of current risk profile; other documents lack this detail |
| New vulnerability discovered in application | Discuss with application owner and security manager, recommend addition to risk register | Documents the risk for tracking and response |
| Risk is no longer relevant | Remove from risk register | Keeps register accurate and actionable |
| Activity that triggers a risk is initiated | Add new risk to risk register | Captures emerging risks when they become relevant |
| Presenting current risk profile to senior management | Use risk register dashboard | Provides complete picture of organization's risk profile |
| Risk identified but not yet mitigated | Capture in risk register with remediation status | Enables monitoring of outstanding risks |

## Gotchas

- **Register vs. profile confusion**: The risk register is the document; the
  risk profile is the aggregated status. Changes in the profile must be
  reflected in the register.

- **Primary purpose misunderstanding**: The primary purpose of maintaining a
  risk register is to drive risk response, not merely to document risks.
  Documentation is a means to that end.

- **Accuracy maintenance**: Centralized publication with periodic polling by
  risk assessors is the most effective method to keep the register accurate
  over time. Outsourcing or relying on audit personnel alone is insufficient.

- **Industry benchmarks excluded**: Risk registers typically do not include
  industry benchmarks or communication plans. Focus is on risk-specific data:
  scenarios, impact, probability, score, owner, and treatment.

- **Determining current risk profile**: When evaluating current risk profile
  after addressing prior gaps, perform a new independent risk assessment.
  Reviewing previous controls alone will not identify new or emerging risks.

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Risk register contents | Scenario, impact, probability, score, owner, treatment | Industry benchmarks and communication plans excluded |
| Risk removal timing | When risk is no longer relevant | Not when controls are implemented |
| Risk addition timing | When activity triggering the risk is initiated | Proactive capture of emerging risks |
| Review frequency | Periodic intervals | Defined by organizational policy |

## Related topics

- **Key Risk Indicators (KRI)**: Monitored periodically to detect changes in
  risk profile. Primary reason for KRI monitoring is that risk profile changes
  over time.
- **Risk ownership**: Must be documented in the risk register. Risk owner is
  accountable for managing the risk within acceptable levels.
- **Inherent, residual, and current risk**: Risk register tracks the
  progression from inherent to residual risk as controls are implemented.
- **Risk appetite and tolerance**: Register updates must consider whether
  residual risk remains within acceptable levels.
- **Risk reporting**: Risk register dashboard provides the most comprehensive
  view for senior management reporting on organizational risk status.

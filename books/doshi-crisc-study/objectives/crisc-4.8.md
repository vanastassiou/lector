# 4.8: Security awareness training programs

Source: CRISC Exam Study Guide - Hemang Doshi

## Key concepts

- **Security awareness training**: Most important element of information
  security program; technical controls alone cannot address all security risks
  - Addresses behavioral aspects through continuous awareness and education
  - Compliance with security policy best ensured through education
  - Continuous activity starting from employee onboarding

- **Customization by audience**: Most effective success factor for training
  programs
  - System developers: enhanced training on secure coding practices
  - Data entry operators: security aspects related to their specific functions
  - Common messages tailored for different groups

- **Training content focus areas**: Password selection, acceptable use of
  information resources, social engineering attacks, email safety, web browser
  safety

- **Top-down approach**: Senior management commitment required for program
  success
  - Provides resources and organizational support
  - Influential employees act as security ambassadors within departments

- **Training timing for new employees**: Must occur before system or data
  access is granted; part of orientation program

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Heavy increase in malware attacks | Conduct regular awareness training on user roles and responsibilities | Educated employees detect attacks quickly and prevent adverse impact |
| Need to reduce social engineering risk | Enterprise-wide security awareness program | Users educated to recognize manipulation attempts |
| Improving password policy effectiveness | Frequent security awareness programs | Obtains buy-in from end users; more effective than audits or penalties |
| Addressing internal security threats | Periodic awareness training for all employees and third parties with data/system access | Helps identify threat symptoms and take timely action |
| Changing organizational security culture | Security awareness campaigns | Gradual process requiring frequent employee training |
| Employees installing unlicensed software | Additional security awareness training | KRI indicates awareness gap |
| Ethics concerns in monitoring activities | Ethics awareness training for employees involved in monitoring | Primary target audience for ethics training |

## Gotchas

- **Increase in incident/violation reports indicates success**: More reporting
  means staff recognize and report issues; decrease may indicate lack of
  awareness
- **Human element is weakest link**: Staff have most chances of failure
  compared to software, processes, or hardware; vulnerable to error and fraud
- **Social engineering tests more effective than just training content**:
  Periodic simulated attacks maintain alertness and remind users threats are
  real
- **DLP cannot fully compensate for awareness gaps**: Attackers can use social
  engineering to obtain credentials and bypass DLP solutions
- **Awareness training is not a one-time event**: Continuous activity at
  frequent intervals; culture change is gradual

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| HR department primary security responsibility | Security awareness training | Not budget, recruitment, or risk assessment |
| Effectiveness measure | Increase in violation reports | Not training count, budget spent, or helpdesk requests |
| Primary program objective | Influence employee behavior toward security consciousness | Decrease security incidents |
| New employee training timing | Before any system/data access | Part of orientation program |

## Related topics

- **Social engineering**: Primary reason for enterprise-wide awareness programs;
  attacks manipulate users into divulging credentials
- **BYOD risks**: Requires periodic awareness training on proper use of personal
  devices
- **Deepfake risks**: Administrative controls and periodic security awareness
  needed for procedures using video/voice authorization
- **Password policy**: Effectiveness improved through frequent awareness
  programs rather than audits or penalties
- **Classification policy**: Content should be part of security awareness
  program; without user awareness, policy implementation fails
- **Compensating controls**: Awareness training is secondary to log review when
  segregation of duties cannot be implemented
- **Outsourcing risk**: Annual awareness training for service provider employees
  is one mitigation option but audit verification is more effective

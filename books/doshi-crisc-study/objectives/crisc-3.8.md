# 3.8: Establish Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) and thresholds for monitoring

Source: CRISC Exam Study Guide - Hemang Doshi

## Key concepts

- **Key Risk Indicator (KRI)**: A measure used to determine the level of current
  risk for an activity. KRIs flag exceptions as they occur, providing opportunity
  to respond before damage is done.
  - Objective is to monitor risk levels and receive alerts when approaching
    unacceptable levels
  - Examples: unauthorized software count, system downtime hours, systems
    without antivirus

- **Threshold**: The minimum requirement or maximum limit within which a KRI is
  expected to operate.
  - Indicates whether controls are providing intended value
  - Must be aligned with risk appetite and risk tolerance
  - Requires periodic review as risk profile changes

- **Lead indicators**: Forward-looking; provide warning signals for emerging
  high risk (preventive controls)

- **Lag indicators**: Backward-looking; indicate past occurrences and provide
  trends and historical data to improve risk response

## SMART criteria for KRI selection

| Criterion | Requirement |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Specific | Clear, concise, easily understandable |
| Measurable | Quantifiable with no subjectivity |
| Attainable | Realistic targets |
| Relevant | Aligned with organizational goals and objectives |
| Time-bound | Achievable within a given time frame |

## KRI design priorities

Design aspects in order of priority:

1. KRI should be linked to specific risk (most important)
2. KRI should be capable to predict a risk event
3. KRI should be complete and accurate
4. KRI should be easily measurable and comparable
5. KRI should be repeatable to be effective over time

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Identifying when to establish KRIs | During risk response stage (before risk monitoring) | Controls are selected and implemented at this stage; KRIs measure control effectiveness |
| KRI reaches threshold | Report first to business process owner | Owner determines risk response and evaluates if additional controls are needed |
| Validating line manager's KRI monitoring | Independent review of reported results | Ensures unbiasedness and validates efficiency of monitoring efforts |
| Designing effective KRIs | Document end-to-end operational flow of business processes | Enables understanding of data flows, decision processes, risk appetite, and tolerance |
| Monitoring third-party risk | Use indicators with approved thresholds | Determines acceptable risk levels; exceeding thresholds triggers management alarm |

## KRI threshold example

| System downtime | Risk indicator |
| --------------- | -------------- |
| Less than 5 hours | Acceptable |
| Between 5-10 hours | Close monitoring |
| More than 10 hours | Unacceptable |

## Gotchas

- **KRI threshold must evolve with risk profile**: A threshold acceptable today
  (e.g., 10% defect rate) may become unacceptable later (e.g., 2%) due to
  changing market conditions

- **KRIs identified during risk response, not monitoring**: Controls are
  implemented first, then KRIs are developed to measure control effectiveness

- **Independent monitoring required**: KRIs should be measured by an
  independent team. If measured by line managers, results must be reviewed by
  independent authority

- **Threshold capability is critical for control lifecycle**: Without thresholds
  that identify when controls fail, organizations may believe ineffective
  controls are still working

- **Events below threshold do not require escalation**: If adverse events have
  negligible impact and remain within set thresholds, senior management may not
  need notification

## Advantages of KRIs

- Validates risk appetite and risk tolerance levels
- Identifies risk objectively
- Quantifies risk
- Enables continuous risk monitoring
- Triggers risk mitigation action
- Monitors regulatory compliance

## Reporting and monitoring responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
| ---- | -------------- |
| Independent team | Measure and monitor KRIs to ensure unbiasedness |
| Line manager | Monitor KRIs (with independent review) |
| Senior official | Review and validate monitoring efforts |
| Business process owner | First recipient when KRI reaches threshold; evaluates control effectiveness |
| Senior management | Receives periodic KRI results to determine current state of risk |

## Related topics

- **Risk profile**: Overall risk status the organization is exposed to; KRIs
  help keep this updated with new and emerging risks
- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: Measures performance of business
  targets; often used in combination with KRIs
- **Key Control Indicators (KCIs)**: Measures control effectiveness
- **Risk appetite and tolerance**: KRI thresholds must align with these
  organizational parameters
- **Continuous monitoring**: Process and technology used to monitor critical
  areas on an ongoing basis; typically applied to high-risk areas

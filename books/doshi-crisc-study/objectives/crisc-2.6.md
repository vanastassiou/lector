# 2.6: Determine risk appetite and tolerance aligned with business objectives

Source: CRISC Exam Study Guide - Hemang Doshi

## Key concepts

- **Risk capacity**: Maximum risk an organization can afford to take
  - Always greater than tolerance and appetite
  - Represents absolute upper limit of risk exposure
- **Risk appetite**: Amount of risk an organization is willing to take
  - Also referred to as acceptable risk
  - Must never exceed risk capacity
  - Defined and approved by senior management
- **Risk tolerance**: Acceptable deviation from risk appetite
  - Permissible variance above stated appetite level
  - Always lower than risk capacity
  - Can be equal to or greater than appetite

## Relationship hierarchy

Risk capacity > Risk tolerance >= Risk appetite

Example: An investor has $1000 total savings (capacity), decides to invest up to
$700 (appetite), but is willing to go up to $750 if markets are favorable
(tolerance).

## Alignment with business objectives

- **Purpose**: Ensures resources are directed toward areas of low risk tolerance
- **Critical processes**: Require thorough monitoring and tighter controls
- **Resource allocation**: Organizations deploy more resources to objectives
  with higher business impact
- **Control prioritization**: Build more controls where appetite and tolerance
  are low

## Determining compliance with risk appetite

- Compare residual risk against acceptable risk level
- Residual risk must remain within risk appetite
- If residual risk exceeds appetite, additional risk response is required
- Compliance is achieved when residual risk <= acceptable risk

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Critical application has high risk, organization has moderate appetite | Evaluate controls to mitigate risk | Bring risk within acceptable levels without changing appetite |
| Lack of sufficient resources to treat risk | Define risk priorities to support resource allocation | Prioritization ensures critical risks are addressed first |
| Risk exceeds tolerance | Address immediately through risk response | Risks exceeding tolerance require treatment |

## Factors affecting risk appetite

- **Risk culture**: Organizational attitudes toward risk taking
  - Risk-prone organizations have higher appetite
  - Risk-averse organizations have lower appetite
- **Predisposition toward risk taking**: Management inclination
- **Industry norms**: Sector-specific risk expectations
- **Business complexity**: More complex operations may require different
  appetite levels

## Risk culture relationship

- Risk management methodology depends on organizational risk culture
- Risk-prone vs risk-averse organizations require different approaches
- Symptoms of problematic risk culture:
  - Gap between documented appetite and actual employee behavior
  - Blame-focused discussions instead of root cause analysis
- Poor communication leads to acceptance of risk exceeding appetite

## Periodic review requirements

- Risk appetite and tolerance require regular review
- Triggers for reassessment:
  - New technology adoption
  - Organizational restructuring
  - Changes in business strategy
  - Shifts in risk portfolio

## Benefits of defining appetite and tolerance

- Provides evidence of risk-based decision-making
- Shows how each enterprise component contributes to overall risk profile
- Supports prioritization and approval of risk response
- Identifies specific areas requiring risk response

## Gotchas

- **Tolerance vs appetite confusion**: Tolerance is the deviation allowed from
  appetite, not a separate threshold
- **Senior management role**: Only senior management approves risk appetite
  and tolerance for information security
- **Residual vs inherent risk**: Compliance is measured against residual risk
  (after controls), not inherent risk
- **Resource prioritization**: High-risk objectives aligned with appetite should
  receive priority resources, not all objectives equally

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Approval authority | Senior management | Enterprise-level appetite decisions |
| Review frequency | Regular intervals | Triggered by strategy or environment changes |
| Risk acceptance limit | Within appetite | Never exceed capacity |

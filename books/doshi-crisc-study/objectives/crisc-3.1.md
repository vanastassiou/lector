# 3.1: Consult with risk owners to align risk responses with organizational objectives

Source: CRISC Exam Study Guide - Hemang Doshi

## Key concepts

- **Risk ownership**: The assignment of accountability for managing a specific
  risk to a senior official with the authority to select and implement
  appropriate risk responses.
  - Risk should be assigned to an individual, not a department or group
  - Business process owners are the natural risk owners for their respective
    processes
  - Risk owners should also own associated controls and ensure their
    effectiveness
  - Details must be documented in the risk register

- **Risk practitioner's consultative role**: The risk practitioner advises risk
  owners on technologies, policies, procedures, and control effectiveness.
  - Ultimate decision authority for risk treatment resides with the risk owner
  - Risk practitioner provides analysis and guidance; risk owner makes decisions
  - When monitoring identifies noncompliance, the practitioner should discuss
    with the risk owner and recommend control review

- **Alignment with organizational objectives**: Risk responses must support
  business goals rather than being selected in isolation.
  - First consideration when selecting a risk response is whether it supports
    organizational goals and objectives
  - Risks that impact objectives should be prioritized and responded to first
  - Risk appetite should be aligned with business objectives to direct resources
    toward areas of low risk tolerance

- **Communication requirements**: Results of risk monitoring must be shared with
  risk owners.
  - Risk owners are accountable for maintaining risk within acceptable levels
  - Risk reporting provides a summary of assessment results so owners can
    initiate corrective action
  - Presentation should be tailored to the audience (e.g., dashboards for senior
    management)

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Multiple risk response alternatives exist | Conduct cost-benefit analysis and present options to risk owner | Risk owner must make informed decision based on organizational value |
| Control monitoring reveals noncompliance | Discuss with risk owner and recommend control review | Risk owner is accountable and must decide on corrective action |
| New vulnerability discovered in authentication system | Identify affected systems and notify business owners immediately | Business owners (risk owners) are responsible for responding to new risks |
| Determining if IT supports business objectives | Interview business process owners | They understand specific business requirements and whether IT serves them |
| Risk exceeds tolerance level | Prepare risk treatment plan with detailed actions, timelines, and responsible parties | Risk owner needs actionable plan to bring risk within acceptable levels |

## Gotchas

- **Assigning risk to departments instead of individuals**: Allocating
  accountability to a department circumvents ownership. Always assign to a
  specific person.

- **Risk practitioner making risk decisions**: The practitioner advises and
  recommends; the risk owner decides. Ultimate decision authority stays with
  the risk owner.

- **Delegating risk means transferring accountability**: When risk owners
  delegate management tasks to others, they remain ultimately responsible for
  monitoring and controlling the risk.

- **Responding to all identified risks**: Not required. Only risks that impact
  organizational objectives warrant response. Resource availability is not the
  prime consideration; alignment with objectives is.

- **Using industry good practices as the selection criterion**: Industry
  practices are secondary. The primary criterion is whether the response
  supports organizational goals and objectives.

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Ultimate accountability | Board of Directors | Senior management designs strategy; board oversees |
| Risk ownership documentation | Risk register | Must include likelihood, impact, priority, mitigation status, and owner |
| Monitoring results communication | Risk owner (mandatory) | Other functions receive as secondary recipients |
| Risk action plan contents | Start date, end date, responsible person, detailed action plan | Treat as a project with milestones |

## Related topics

- **Risk register**: The documented inventory containing risk ownership details,
  treatment status, and the foundation for consultation between practitioners
  and owners.

- **Risk appetite alignment**: When appetite is aligned with business objectives,
  resources are directed toward high-risk areas that matter to the organization.

- **Cost-benefit analysis**: The primary method for evaluating risk response
  alternatives during consultation with risk owners.

- **Accountability vs. responsibility**: Board of Directors holds ultimate
  accountability; risk owners are responsible for their assigned risks.

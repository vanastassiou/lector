# 2.7: Collaborate on risk awareness program and training for stakeholders

Source: CRISC Exam Study Guide (Hemang Doshi)

## Key concepts

- **Security awareness training**: Most important element of the information
  security program. Technical controls alone cannot address all security risks;
  behavioral aspects require continuous education.
  - Training should be customized per target audience
  - Developers need secure coding training; data entry operators need
    function-specific security training
  - Compliance with security policy is best ensured through education

- **Risk culture**: Values, beliefs, knowledge, and attitudes about risk shared
  across the organization. Reflects senior management's tendency to embrace,
  accept, or avoid risk.
  - Risk culture drives risk appetite
  - Methodology selection depends on whether organization is risk-prone or
    risk-averse

- **Risk-aware culture benefits**:
  - Timely and accurate escalation of suspicious activity
  - More informed risk decisions by senior management
  - Greater stakeholder awareness
  - Transparency to external parties regarding risk posture

- **Top-down approach**: Security programs must have visible senior management
  commitment. This provides budget, authority, and legitimacy for the program.
  - Influential employees act as security ambassadors within departments

- **RACI model for risk management**:
  - Responsible: Performs actual work
  - Accountable: Single person who oversees and manages (must be specific
    individual)
  - Consulted: Provides support (may be internal, external, or regulators)
  - Informed: Notified but not directly involved in execution

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Heavy increase in malware attacks | Conduct regular awareness training on end user roles and responsibilities | Education enables quick detection and prevention |
| Social engineering threats | Periodic simulated attacks with results communicated to staff | Tests maintain alertness; show threats are real |
| Internal security threats | Periodic awareness training for employees and third parties | Helps identify threat symptoms early |
| New employee onboarding | Complete training before data or system access | User must know secure handling before access |
| Promoting password policy compliance | Frequent security awareness programs | Gradual buy-in from users; more effective than penalties |

## Gotchas

- **Increased incident reports indicate success, not failure**: More violation
  reports mean staff recognize and escalate issues. This is the best
  effectiveness metric.

- **Customization beats standardization**: Common messages tailored per group
  are more effective than generic content or industry-standard programs.

- **Training timing matters**: Must occur before access is granted, not after.
  Training is part of orientation for new joiners.

- **Ethics training targets monitors**: Ethics training is primarily for
  employees who monitor user activities, not general staff.

- **Problematic risk culture symptoms**:
  - Gap between documented risk appetite and actual behavior
  - Blame-focused discussions instead of root cause analysis
  - Poor collaboration across the enterprise

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Training frequency | Continuous/periodic | Threats and vulnerabilities change over time |
| Training owner | Information security department | Part of overall security program |
| Key success metric | Increase in security violation reports | Indicates awareness and proactive reporting |
| Ethics training scope | Employees monitoring user activity | Targeted, not organization-wide |

## Related topics

- **Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)**: Installation of unlicensed software indicates
  need for additional training. KRIs help validate training effectiveness.
- **Risk register**: Training gaps may appear as control weaknesses in risk
  documentation.
- **Organizational culture (1.5)**: Risk culture assessment informs training
  approach and methodology selection.
- **Senior management support**: Required for budget, authority, and program
  legitimacy. Strategic view needed for sign-off on risk management.
- **Social engineering**: Primary reason to conduct enterprise-wide awareness
  programs; training reduces likelihood of successful attacks.
- **Data classification**: Classification policy content should be part of
  awareness program; policy ineffective without user training.

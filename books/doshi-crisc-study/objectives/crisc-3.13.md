# 3.13: Review control assessment findings for effectiveness

Source: CRISC Exam Study Guide (Hemang Doshi)

## Key concepts

- **Control assessment**: Process of evaluating controls through testing, audit,
  or self-assessment to determine whether they meet their intended objectives
  - Prime objective: evaluate effectiveness, efficiency, and adequacy
  - Advise risk owner of any gaps identified
  - Test at frequent intervals to verify ongoing performance

- **Control effectiveness**: Degree to which a control achieves its stated
  objectives in reducing likelihood or impact of risk
  - Best determined by reviewing test results against desired objectives
  - Must balance effectiveness with control cost (optimum level)
  - Changes in effectiveness directly impact the organization's risk profile

- **Result of control assessment**: Effectiveness depends on three parameters:
  - Accuracy of data on which controls are evaluated
  - Timely reporting to management for corrective action
  - Skill set of risk practitioner to properly evaluate controls

- **Key Control Indicators (KCI)**: Metrics measuring control effectiveness
  - Also called control effectiveness indicators
  - Provide insight into ongoing adequacy of controls
  - Inversely correlated with KRI (effective controls = risk within limits)
  - Tolerance levels based on criticality of protected assets

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Monitoring indicates noncompliance | Discuss with risk owner; recommend review of controls and additional controls if needed | Risk owner responsible for ensuring risk managed to acceptable level |
| Security exception identified | Validate exception first to rule out false positives | Prevents wasted effort on non-issues |
| Audit finding identified | Create risk mitigation plan with corrective action | Addresses root cause and closes finding |
| Control deficiency suspected | Review defined control objectives first | Objectives define success criteria; unmet objectives indicate deficiency |
| New control implemented | Test to validate effectiveness | Each new control must be evaluated for both effectiveness and additional vulnerabilities |

## Gotchas

- **Test results vs. other metrics**: Cost of implementation, failure
  notification capability, or number of vulnerabilities addressed do not
  determine effectiveness--only test results against desired objectives

- **Optimum vs. maximum control**: Optimum control balances effectiveness with
  cost; cost should be less than perceived risk. Maximum control may be
  cost-prohibitive

- **Control monitoring vs. testing**: Monitoring is ongoing and continuous;
  testing is generally ad hoc. Both serve different purposes in assessing
  effectiveness

- **KPI vs. KRI vs. KCI confusion**: KPIs measure business performance, KRIs
  monitor risk profile changes, KCIs measure control effectiveness. Risk team
  and internal audit focus on KRI and KCI

- **Decreased cost does not indicate effectiveness**: Reduced control cost
  alone does not prove the control works; test results required

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Control assessment frequency | Periodic intervals | Determined by risk level and regulatory requirements |
| KCI tolerance levels | Asset-specific | Based on criticality of information assets being protected |
| Continuous monitoring | High-risk areas | Where impact and frequency of occurrence are both high |
| First step for exceptions | Validate to rule out false positives | Before escalating or remediating |

## Related topics

- **Risk profile**: Control effectiveness changes directly impact the
  organization's overall risk status; must be kept updated

- **Three lines of defense**: Third line (audit) provides control testing and
  attestation; second line provides consulting and monitoring

- **Risk register**: Documents control status, corrective actions, and residual
  risk; updated based on assessment findings

- **Internal audit function**: Role is monitoring, evaluating, examining, and
  reporting on controls; provides recommendations for enhancement

- **Risk reporting**: Must include control effectiveness because changes impact
  risk profile; dashboards, heat maps, and scorecards are common formats

- **Corrective action**: Risk owner receives findings and initiates appropriate
  response; risk mitigation plan used to address audit findings

# 1.7: Promote a risk-aware culture aligned with enterprise risk management

Source: CRISC Exam Study Guide (Hemang Doshi)

## Key concepts

- **Risk culture**: Values, beliefs, knowledge, attitudes and understanding about
  risk shared by an organization. Reflects senior management's tendency to
  embrace, cautiously accept, or avoid risk.
  - Determines risk management methodology selection
  - Influences risk appetite and tolerance levels
  - Observable through management and employee behavior

- **Enterprise risk management (ERM)**: Structured practices, methods and
  processes for managing risks that could adversely impact business objectives.
  - Standardizes risk management across the organization
  - Enables comparison of risk results between departments
  - Requires flexibility to accommodate local culture, priorities and regulations

- **Three lines of defense**: Governance model distributing risk responsibilities.
  - First line (operational management): Business process owners who manage
    daily risks, monitor controls, ensure compliance with risk procedures
  - Second line (risk and compliance): Develops risk framework, policies and
    standards; monitors and oversees risk management across the enterprise
  - Third line (audit): Independent function providing assurance, control testing
    and attestation; reports directly to board

- **Risk ownership**: Business process owners are risk owners for their processes.
  They must identify, assess and report risks to the board. Risk monitoring
  results should be communicated to risk owners who are accountable for
  maintaining risk within acceptable levels.

- **Open communication on risk**: Enables timely escalation of suspicious
  activity, informed decisions by senior management, greater stakeholder
  awareness, and transparency to external parties.

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Selecting risk management methodology | Assess organization's risk culture first | Risk-prone vs risk-averse organizations require different methodologies |
| Determining risk appetite | Evaluate risk culture and inclination toward risk-taking | These are the two primary factors for setting appetite |
| Problematic risk culture detected | Address blame-focused discussions; foster collaboration | Blaming prevents root cause identification and transparent discussion |
| New employee onboarding | Include security awareness before system access | Awareness must precede access to establish proper behavior |
| Improving security culture | Conduct frequent awareness campaigns | Gradual, repeated training changes organizational behavior |

## Gotchas

- **Risk culture vs risk appetite**: Risk culture describes attitudes and values;
  risk appetite is the specific level of risk the organization is willing to accept.
  Culture influences appetite, not the reverse.

- **First line responsibility**: Business process owners manage risk directly and
  monitor controls. They do not develop the risk framework (second line) or
  provide assurance (third line).

- **Awareness timing**: Security awareness training must occur before users
  receive system or data access, not after they become comfortable with systems.

- **Top-down approach required**: Security programs succeed when senior
  management visibly commits to and supports risk awareness. Without executive
  sponsorship, programs lack resources and authority.

- **Maturity indicator**: An organization's risk management maturity is determined
  by its risk culture and awareness level, not by the sophistication of its tools.

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Capability maturity model (CMM) | 0-5 scale | Common method to measure risk management maturity |
| Primary awareness method | Customized training per audience | System developers need secure coding; operators need function-specific training |
| Awareness effectiveness metric | Incident reports from staff | Increase indicates higher awareness, not more incidents |

## Related topics

- **Risk appetite and tolerance (1.12)**: Risk culture directly influences appetite
  setting; culture determines how aggressively the organization pursues risk
- **Policies and standards (1.6)**: Risk culture shapes policy content and
  enforcement; policies formalize cultural expectations
- **Risk monitoring (3.x)**: Monitoring results feed back to risk owners; culture
  affects how openly issues are reported
- **Security awareness training (4.31)**: Primary mechanism for changing
  organizational culture; must be continuous and audience-customized

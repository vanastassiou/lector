# 2.4: Identify key stakeholders for IT risk scenarios to establish accountability

Source: CRISC Exam Study Guide - Hemang Doshi

## Key concepts

- **Stakeholder identification**: Process of determining who has a vested
  interest in IT risk scenarios and who must be involved in managing those
  risks
  - Effectiveness of IT governance and risk management depends on involving all
    relevant stakeholders
  - Stakeholders include internal parties (board, management, process owners)
    and external parties (regulators, auditors, customers)

- **Risk ownership**: Assignment of accountability for managing specific risks
  to individuals with appropriate authority
  - Each risk must have an assigned owner for effective management
  - Risk owners should be senior officials who can select appropriate risk
    responses
  - Ownership is best established by mapping risks to specific business process
    owners
  - Details of risk owners must be documented in the risk register

- **Business process owners**: First line of defense; primary stakeholders for
  IT risk scenarios affecting their processes
  - Generally considered the risk owners for their respective processes
  - Responsible for risk identification, assessment, and reporting to board
  - Best source for determining system effectiveness and criticality
  - Own associated controls and ensure control adequacy

- **RACI model**: Framework for clarifying stakeholder roles in risk management
  - **Responsible**: Performs the work; the person(s) doing the risk management
    activities
  - **Accountable**: Single person who oversees and manages; answerable for the
    outcome; must be assigned to a specific individual
  - **Consulted**: Provides support and assistance; may include external sources
    or regulators
  - **Informed**: Notified of risk management efforts but not directly involved
    in execution

- **Three lines of defense**: Model clarifying essential roles of key
  stakeholders
  - First line: Business process owners who actively manage risk
  - Second line: Risk management and compliance functions that guide, assess,
    and monitor
  - Third line: Internal audit providing independent assurance
  - All three lines must have common goals and coordinated planning

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| New IT risk identified | Notify business process owners first, even with incomplete information | They own the risk and determine response |
| KRI reaches threshold | Report to process owner first | Owner determines risk response and evaluates existing controls |
| Designing IT controls | Gather requirements from stakeholders | Controls must address stakeholder requirements |
| Implementing risk treatment | Assign to individual employee with timeline | Individual accountability ensures follow-through |
| Unclear roles causing duplicate efforts | Implement three lines of defense model | Clarifies roles and responsibilities |
| Risk findings challenged by process owners | Indicates misalignment between risk practices and business strategies | Process owners understand business context best |

## Gotchas

- **Group vs. individual accountability**: Assigning accountability to a
  department rather than a specific individual circumvents ownership and reduces
  effectiveness

- **Delegation vs. accountability**: Risk owners may delegate management tasks
  but remain ultimately accountable; "responsibility can be delegated,
  accountability cannot"

- **Outsourcing and accountability**: Outsourcing processes does not reduce or
  remove the organization's accountability for managing those risks

- **Three lines planning independently**: Each line conducting its own planning
  independently is a major concern; common goals and coordination are essential

- **Ultimate accountability**: Accountability for risk management ultimately
  lies with senior management and the board, not with risk practitioners or IT
  departments

- **Users as stakeholders**: Users of IT services are generally the application
  owners and risk owners; CTO, CFO, and CRO support but do not own business risk

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Accountable parties | Single individual | Never assign accountability to a group |
| Risk register documentation | Required for all risk owners | Must include ownership details |
| First line communication | Business process owners | Primary recipients of risk monitoring results |
| Audit trail purpose | Establish accountability | Captures transaction details to trace responsibility |

## Related topics

- **Risk register**: Documents risk ownership and serves as authoritative source
  for stakeholder identification per risk scenario
- **Risk communication**: Open communication provides transparency to external
  stakeholders and enables informed decisions by senior management
- **IT governance**: Primarily the responsibility of board and senior
  management; stakeholder involvement determines implementation effectiveness
- **Control monitoring**: Results should be communicated to risk owners who
  determine appropriate response actions

## Key concepts

- **Business and IT alignment**: IT activities must align with business objectives
  to deliver value. The risk practitioner should verify that IT and business
  requirements are integrated and moving in the same direction.
  - A strategic IT plan must contain a clear statement of IT's vision and mission
  - IT can add value only when IT strategies align with business strategy

- **Enterprise governance of IT (EGIT)**: Process for monitoring and controlling
  IT activities. Ensures IT provides added value and that IT risks are addressed.
  - Board of Directors holds primary responsibility for EGIT
  - Implemented through leadership, organizational structures, policies, and
    performance monitoring

- **First step in understanding strategic IT risk**: Discuss with senior
  executives to understand the business strategy and goals. This provides insight
  into expectations and dependencies from IT, revealing potential risks.

- **Business process review**: Evaluates effectiveness and efficiency of
  processes in achieving objectives.
  - Purpose: identify process issues, gather improvement information, review
    project progress
  - Business process owners provide the best feedback on IT system effectiveness
  - They understand system functionalities and linkage to business objectives

- **Documentation review before risk assessment**: Primary purpose is to
  understand current business processes.
  - Risk assessment is effective only when the assessor understands business
    objectives, processes, and environment
  - Reviewer should have thorough understanding of business processes and
    technology under scope

- **Organizational chart review**: Primary purpose is understanding roles,
  responsibilities, and authority of individuals. Helps determine proper
  segregation of functions.

- **Organizational assets**: Includes people, technology, data, intellectual
  property, and business processes.
  - Risk management's prime objective is safeguarding these assets
  - Asset valuation considers: reputational loss, third-party impact, business
    continuity, monetary loss, contract breaches, competitive advantage loss

- **Risk culture**: Values, beliefs, and attitudes about risk held by the
  organization.
  - Determines risk management methodology selection
  - Risk appetite depends on culture and predisposition toward risk taking
  - Mature culture: employees recognize risk, discuss it openly, collaborate to
    resolve

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Determine if IT supports business objectives | Interview business process owners | They understand system functionalities and linkage to objectives; unbiased viewpoint |
| Understand strategic IT risk | Discuss with senior executives first | Provides view of expectations, dependencies, and potential risks |
| Review documentation before risk assessment | Focus on understanding current business processes | Assessment effective only with awareness of objectives, processes, environment |
| Review organizational chart | Identify roles, responsibilities, authority | Determines proper segregation of functions |
| IT governance effectiveness unclear | Ensure stakeholder involvement | Addressing stakeholder needs drives IT governance success |

## Gotchas

- **Senior management vs. process owners**: Interview senior executives to
  understand strategic risk and goals; interview business process owners to
  assess IT system effectiveness

- **First step confusion**: First step in risk identification is information
  gathering about current and future business environment, not risk ranking or
  threat identification

- **Documentation review purpose**: Not primarily for finding gaps or determining
  cost, but for understanding business processes and objectives

- **Risk culture vs. industry practices**: Risk management methodology selection
  depends primarily on the organization's risk culture, not industry practices or
  cost-benefit analysis

- **Centralized vs. decentralized governance**: Centralized provides more
  consistency and resource optimization; decentralized provides better local
  alignment and faster turnaround

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Information security policy review | Annual minimum | Required to address new and emerging risks |
| IT governance responsibility | Board of Directors | Primary, not delegated |
| Risk management sign-off | Senior Management | Final approval authority |
| Risk program execution | Mid-level management | Centrally located with operational understanding |

# 3.2: Assist risk owners in developing risk action plans

Source: CRISC Exam Study Guide (Hemang Doshi)

## Key concepts

- **Risk practitioner role**: Plays a consultative role in assisting risk owners
  with deciding and implementing risk treatment. Provides advice on
  technologies, policies, procedures, and control effectiveness. Ultimate
  decision authority resides with the risk owner.

- **Risk owner**: Senior official with authority and experience to select
  appropriate risk response. Owns associated controls and ensures their
  effectiveness and adequacy. Should be an individual employee, not a group or
  department.

- **Risk action plan**: Created once a risk response is finalized and documented
  in the risk register. Must include:
  - Start date
  - End date
  - Details about strategy
  - Responsible person or team

- **Risk treatment plan**: Structured approach to treating identified risks.
  Prepared for all risks exceeding tolerance levels. Monitored regularly to
  track progress. Should be treated as a project with measurable timelines,
  budget, and milestones.

- **Deciding factors for risk treatment selection**:
  - Risk appetite of the organization
  - Applicable laws and regulations
  - Management priorities
  - Current level of risk
  - Industry and market forces

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Current risk exceeds risk appetite | Evaluate different risk response alternatives using cost-benefit analysis | Further response required to bring risk to acceptable level |
| Insufficient resources for treatment | Define risk priorities to support resource allocation | Prioritization enables effective use of limited resources |
| Mitigation action plan approved | Assign to responsible individual with deadlines | Individual accountability with timelines ensures implementation |
| Need to keep risk at acceptable level | Periodic review of controls per risk action plan | Regular review ensures ongoing control effectiveness |
| Selecting between response options | Conduct cost-benefit analysis | Implementation cost must be justified by benefit realized |

## Gotchas

- **Group assignment trap**: Assigning risk ownership to a department rather
  than an individual circumvents accountability. Always assign to a specific
  person.

- **Practitioner vs owner authority**: Risk practitioners advise; risk owners
  decide. The ultimate decision to adopt risk treatment resides with the risk
  owner, not the practitioner.

- **Incidents not in scope**: Already-occurred incidents (realized risks) are
  not in scope of risk treatment plans. Treatment plans address future risk
  mitigation.

- **Accepted risks excluded**: If risk is already accepted by risk owners, a
  risk treatment plan is not required.

- **Cost-benefit misconception**: If benefit from a control is less than
  implementation cost, the control is not justified. Selection of controls is
  primarily based on cost-benefit analysis.

- **Critical path monitoring**: Delays in critical path elements increase
  overall project risk. Action plans should be managed as projects with proper
  milestone tracking.

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Risk treatment plan scope | Risks exceeding tolerance | Not required for accepted, avoided, or transferred risks |
| Ownership assignment | Individual employee | Not groups or departments |
| Plan review frequency | Regular/periodic | Ensures controls remain effective |
| Cost-benefit threshold | Benefit > Implementation cost | Control not justified if cost exceeds benefit |

  risk and selecting appropriate responses
- **Cost-benefit analysis (3.3)**: Primary technique for evaluating and
  prioritizing risk response alternatives
- **Risk register**: Central documentation for risk action plans, ownership, and
  treatment status
- **Three lines model**: First line (business process owners) manages risks as
  risk owners; second line provides guidance
- **Control monitoring**: Results communicated to risk owners who are
  accountable for maintaining acceptable risk levels

# 3.14: Report on risk profile, control performance, and trends to stakeholders

Source: CRISC Exam Study Guide - Hemang Doshi

## Key concepts

- **Risk reporting**: Process of communicating risk assessment results to risk
  owners and stakeholders to enable informed decisions and corrective action
  - Objective: help people make informed decisions and take necessary action
  - Content should be tailored to the target audience
  - Closely associated with risk monitoring

- **Risk profile**: Overall risk status the organization is exposed to
  - Must be kept updated with new and emerging risks
  - Updated in the risk register to reflect current status
  - Changes should be reported to senior management for educated
    decision-making
  - Factors that change risk profile: new technologies, business process
    changes, regulatory changes, market demand, competitor policies

- **Control performance reporting**: Communicating control effectiveness
  through KRIs
  - KRIs within threshold indicate controls are effective
  - KRIs exceeding threshold indicate additional controls may be required
  - Control monitoring is ongoing; control testing is ad hoc

- **Lead and lag indicators**:
  - Lead indicators: forward-looking, provide warning signals for emerging risk
  - Lag indicators: backward-looking, provide trends and historical data
  - Both are required to improve risk response

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Report risk to senior management | Use dashboard | Provides high-level overview that can be easily understood and tailored |
| Present current risk profile | Use risk register dashboard | Gives complete picture of organization's risk profile |
| Communicate current state of risk | Use KRI measurement results | Most useful data for management to determine current risk state |
| Tailor report content | Consider target audience | Ensures information is presented in understandable and usable form |
| Report KRI reaching threshold | Alert business process owner first | Owner determines risk response and evaluates control effectiveness |

## Gotchas

- **Dashboard vs balanced scorecard**: Dashboard is for risk reporting;
  balanced scorecard monitors IT performance but is not suitable for reporting

- **Risk register vs risk profile**: Risk register is the document that tracks
  risks; risk profile is the overall status derived from it

- **Control monitoring vs testing**: Monitoring is ongoing and validates
  controls continuously; testing is ad hoc. Exam questions prefer monitoring
  for ongoing validation

- **KRI alerts go to process owner first**: When KRI reaches threshold, report
  to business process owner before senior management. Owner evaluates and
  determines response

- **Risk reporting objective**: Primary objective is to provide information to
  risk owner for responding to risk, not compliance or assurance purposes

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Heat map axes | Probability x Impact | Score = probability weight x impact weight |
| Common report formats | Heat maps, scorecards, dashboards | Used for risk reporting |
| KRI monitoring frequency | Periodic intervals | Risk profile changes over time |
| KRI review by | Independent team or independent reviewer | Ensures unbiasedness |

## Related topics

- **Risk register**: Primary document for tracking risk profile changes and
  driving risk response (Objective 2.8)

- **Key risk indicators**: Measure control effectiveness and alert when
  controls fail to provide intended value (Objective 3.18)

- **Control monitoring**: Validates controls on ongoing basis; results feed
  into risk reporting (Objective 3.15)

- **Risk culture**: Open communication on risk provides transparency to
  stakeholders and enables informed decisions (Objective 1.4)

- **Control assessment types**: IS audit, vulnerability assessment, and
  penetration testing provide data for control performance reporting
  (Objective 3.16)

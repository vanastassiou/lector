# 3.12: Monitor and evaluate KPIs to measure control efficiency

Source: CRISC Exam Study Guide - Hemang Doshi

## Key concepts

- **Key Performance Indicator (KPI)**: Metric that measures how well a process
  is doing in terms of its goals and objectives
  - Operates similarly to risk indicators but focuses on performance rather
    than risk
  - Provides warning when values exceed defined thresholds
  - Used in combination with KRIs to measure performance and mitigate risk

- **KPI vs KRI vs KCI distinction**: Critical for exam success
  - KPI: Monitors business performance targets ("Are we achieving desired
    performance levels?")
  - KRI: Monitors risk profile changes ("Is risk within tolerance?")
  - KCI: Monitors control effectiveness ("Are controls working?")
  - Senior management focuses primarily on KPIs; risk teams and auditors focus
    on KRI and KCI

- **Thresholds**: Define acceptable operating ranges for indicators
  - Values within threshold indicate acceptable performance
  - Values outside threshold require immediate attention and escalation
  - Most important aspect when developing metrics to monitor control
    effectiveness

- **Control efficiency monitoring objective**: Ensure desired metrics are
  achieved
  - Not risk management (that's KRI)
  - Not control effectiveness (that's KCI)
  - Not business goals (that's KGI)

## SMART characteristics of good KPIs

| Characteristic | Requirement |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| Specific | Linked to a specific business goal |
| Measurable | Comparable over a period of time |
| Achievable | Realistic and based on important objectives |
| Relevant | Provides value to process owner and management |
| Timely | Enables timely response when thresholds exceeded |

Additional requirements:
- Simple enough for stakeholders to understand
- Meaningful to the recipient
- Agreed upon by relevant stakeholders and approved by senior management

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Error rate reaches 10% threshold | KPI provides warning for escalation | KPI monitors performance against defined limits |
| Evaluating disaster recovery readiness | Review results of tests and exercises | Demonstrates actual capability, not just documentation |
| Measuring control management effectiveness | Measure control effectiveness against business objectives | Primary KPI for control performance |
| Operational review of processing environment | User satisfaction survey | Indicates how well processes meet user expectations |
| KPI value outside threshold | Attend immediately | Leading indicator requires remedial action |

## Control monitoring and reporting

- **Role of risk practitioner**: Assist in planning, reporting, and scheduling
  tests of IS controls
  - Not responsible for implementing or operating controls
  - Not responsible for approving monitoring policy
  - Discusses noncompliance with risk owner and recommends corrective action

- **Control monitoring sources**:
  - Security Operations Centre (SOC) and Network Operations Centre (NOC)
  - Tools and software for continuous control monitoring
  - Periodic control testing
  - Control self-assessment

- **Control assessment effectiveness depends on**:
  - Accuracy of data used to evaluate controls
  - Timely reporting to management for corrective action
  - Skill set of risk practitioner to properly evaluate controls

- **Reporting formats**: Heat maps, scorecards, and dashboards
  - Risk dashboard is most suitable for senior management reporting
  - Provides high-level overview that can be easily tailored

## Gotchas

- **KPI requires immediate attention when outside threshold**: Not when
  fluctuating, within threshold, or below average

- **Most important criteria for metric effectiveness**: Must be meaningful to
  the recipient, not just complete, accurate, consistent, or cost-effective

- **Attainable feature of KPI**: Determines that KPI is realistic and based on
  important objectives (not cost-effective, repeatable, or relevant)

- **Organizations often conflate KPI, KRI, and KCI**: In practice everything
  may be called "KPI" but exam requires precise distinction

- **Optimum control level**: Balance between control effectiveness and cost of
  maintaining the control, not just highlighting ineffectiveness

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Performance threshold action | Outside threshold | Requires immediate escalation |
| KRI threshold revision | Periodic | As risk profile changes over time |
| Continuous monitoring scope | High-risk areas | Where impact and frequency are high |

## Related topics

- **Control testing (3.11)**: Best way to determine control effectiveness is
  to test controls; testing identifies design flaws, failures, and redundancies
- **KRI monitoring (3.16)**: KRI thresholds indicate whether controls provide
  intended value; periodic monitoring addresses new risks
- **Key Control Indicators (3.19)**: KCI measures control effectiveness; KRI
  and KCI are inversely correlated
- **Risk reporting**: Enables risk owner to initiate appropriate risk response;
  should be tailored to target audience

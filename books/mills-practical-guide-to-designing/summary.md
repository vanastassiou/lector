# A Practical Guide to Designing the Invisible

Robert Mills, 2011

## Core thesis

Design communicates on two levels: the visible (words, images) and the invisible
(colour connotations, typeface personality, tone of voice, wayfinding cues).
Effective web design fuses these invisible elements to tell a coherent story that
users process subconsciously. The invisible layer shapes user emotions, trust,
and behaviour without explicit acknowledgment.

## Key frameworks

### Invisible communication types

- **Name**: The invisible communication spectrum
- **Purpose**: Identifies the channels through which design communicates beyond
  literal content
- **Components**:
  - Colour connotations (emotions, cultural meanings, moods)
  - Signs and wayfinding (icons, symbols, navigation cues)
  - Typeface personality (formal vs informal, historical associations)
  - Tone of voice (how words sound, not just what they say)
  - Brand consistency (unified story across all touchpoints)
- **Application**: Audit each channel when designing; ensure all channels tell
  the same story

### The 7-38-55 rule (Mehrabian)

- **Name**: Communication ratio model
- **Purpose**: Demonstrates that meaning comes primarily from non-verbal cues
- **Components**:
  - Words convey 7% of meaning
  - Tone of voice conveys 38%
  - Body language conveys 55%
- **Application**: On the web, we lack body language and vocal tone. Compensate
  by investing heavily in typeface choice, colour, imagery, and written tone.
  Every word counts more.

### Wayfinding four stages (Lidwell, Holden, Butler)

- **Name**: Universal wayfinding process
- **Purpose**: Maps how users navigate any environment, physical or digital
- **Components**:
  1. Orientation: knowing where you are relative to surroundings and destination
  2. Route decision: choosing how to reach the destination
  3. Route monitoring: confirming you're still on track
  4. Destination recognition: knowing when you've arrived
- **Application**: Design navigation to answer three questions at every page:
  - Past: where have I come from?
  - Present: where am I?
  - Future: where can I go next?

### Peirce's sign classification

- **Name**: Icon, index, symbol triad
- **Purpose**: Categorizes how signs create meaning
- **Components**:
  - Icon: resembles what it signifies (printer icon looks like a printer)
  - Index: directly connected to the signified (smoke indexes fire, hyperlink
    indexes a page)
  - Symbol: abstract representation requiring learned convention (heart symbol
    for love)
- **Application**: Prefer icons for universal recognition; use symbols only when
  conventions are established in your audience's culture

### Colour communication model

- **Name**: Natural vs psychological associations
- **Purpose**: Distinguishes how colour meaning forms
- **Components**:
  - Natural associations: derived from environment (blue = sea/sky, green =
    nature)
  - Psychological associations: learned through culture and experience (red =
    danger on road signs)
- **Application**: Research your audience's cultural context. Never assume
  colour meanings are universal.

## Decision heuristics

| When | Do | Because |
| ---- | -- | ------- |
| Users scan rather than read | Make every word count; support copy with icons and colour | Web reading is non-linear; users need quick orientation cues |
| Choosing colours for a global audience | Default to white or neutral tones | White is peaceful, inoffensive, and crosses cultural boundaries |
| Designing for children | Use bright, bold colours; avoid green | Children dislike green (vegetables); bright colours create happy environments |
| Designing for hospitals or stressful contexts | Use blue, green, or neutral beige | These tones slow heart rate and induce calm |
| Creating food-related designs | Avoid blue | Blue suppresses appetite |
| Needing to convey urgency or action | Use red for CTAs | Red is an attention-grabber and stimulant; increases respiration |
| Targeting professional/formal audiences | Use serif typefaces | Serifs connote tradition, sophistication, intelligence |
| Targeting casual/friendly audiences | Use sans-serif typefaces | Sans-serifs feel modern, approachable, informal |
| Icons alone may confuse | Anchor icons with text labels | Not all icons are universally understood; text clarifies |
| Colour-coding sections | Always support colour with other cues | Never rely on colour alone; some users are colourblind, and meanings vary |
| A sign's colour conflicts with its meaning | Fix the colour | A green "stop" sign confuses because shape says no but colour says go |
| Writing copy for the web | Be concise, objective, and scannable | Users scan pages; every word must earn its place |
| Choosing tone of voice | Match it to your product/service, personality, and audience | A mismatch creates conflicting impressions and damages trust |
| Telling a brand story | Use a single dominant element (like a mascot) consistently | Repetition and consistency reinforce the invisible message |

## Memorable formulations

- "Design is like air: you only notice when it's bad."
  - Foreword by Mark Boulton

- "The simpler you keep colour, the more you can say to everybody."
  - Mike Kus, on Carsonified redesign

- "Invisible communication and storytelling are perfect partners, and their
  child is a great user experience."
  - On the relationship between hidden cues and narrative

- "Simplicity and clarity give the visual storyteller room to grow."
  - Andrew Stanton (Wall-E director), on visual storytelling

- "The whale says it all."
  - Matthew Smith, on how one image can encapsulate an entire brand story

- "We have a monstrous appetite for the tiniest details."
  - Squared Eye tagline demonstrating story-copy fusion

- "What people say isn't always what they do."
  - On the gap between stated preferences and actual behaviour (boom box
    example: focus group chose yellow, but everyone took black home)

## Contrarian or non-obvious claims

- **Colour can override shape meaning.** A green prohibition sign feels wrong
  even if the shape clearly says "no." Colour is processed before conscious
  interpretation of form.

- **One colour per page is simpler than multicolour harmony.** The Carsonified
  redesign succeeded by using a single bold colour per page rather than
  attempting balanced multicolour schemes. Bold simplicity beats nuanced
  complexity for memorability.

- **Outsource your own brand discovery.** Matthew Smith (Squared Eye) hired
  external counsel to define his company's identity because "external counsel is
  the most effective way to get to know myself." The creator is too close to see
  clearly.

- **Tourism sites often use white, not culturally specific colours.** Because
  white is inoffensive and neutral, it appeals to diverse audiences without
  triggering culturally specific connotations.

- **Purple has few natural associations, making it feel artificial.** This is
  why purple is linked to magic and fantasy rather than grounded values.

- **Yellow is contradictory.** Associated with happiness, but overuse causes
  headaches and babies cry more in yellow rooms.

- **Colour meaning changes over time.** White was the colour of mourning in
  Japan centuries ago; now it's black. Young Chinese brides now wear white,
  adopting Western tradition.

## Practical techniques

### Colour selection process

1. Identify target audience's cultural context.
2. Research colour meanings within that culture.
3. Check if brand guidelines constrain choices.
4. Select colours that support the story (e.g., green for growth on a jobs
   page).
5. Test combinations for conflict (e.g., red text on green background).
6. Validate against competitors to ensure differentiation.

### Wayfinding system checklist

- Colour-code sections, but always support with labels.
- Use breadcrumbs showing path taken.
- Mark current location visually (arrow, highlight, different shade).
- Show where user can go next with clear navigation hierarchy.
- Use arrows to indicate progression through multi-step processes.
- Provide site index or map for lost users.
- Be consistent across web and mobile.

### Tone of voice development

1. Define product/service personality.
2. Identify audience expectations (formal, informal, technical, friendly).
3. Decide on jargon level, humour, slang, punctuation style.
4. Write sample copy and test with real users.
5. Create a style guide documenting tone rules.
6. Ensure tone is consistent across all touchpoints (404 pages, cart, forms).

### Icon/symbol usage rules

- Use icons that resemble what they signify (home = house, print = printer).
- Support ambiguous icons with text labels.
- Research cultural meanings before using symbols.
- Be consistent: same icon for same function throughout site.
- Test icons with users outside your culture if audience is global.

### Use case method for story discovery

1. Define core actors (buyer, seller) by role, not name.
2. List each actor's goals.
3. Identify shared goals that can be streamlined.
4. Prioritize use cases by project scope.
5. Create basic flow (linear path when everything works).
6. Create alternate flows (what happens when things go wrong).
7. Present data graphically or as narrative outline.

### Storytelling consistency audit

- Check: Does the tone of voice match the visual style?
- Check: Do colours support the brand values?
- Check: Is the typeface appropriate for the audience?
- Check: Are icons and symbols used consistently?
- Check: Does every page answer "where am I, where can I go?"
- Check: Would a user landing on any page understand the brand story?

### Cultural colour quick reference

| Colour | Western | China | India | Japan |
| ------ | ------- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Red | Danger, love, stop | Good luck, marriage | Purity, danger | Courage |
| White | Marriage, peace | Mourning (traditional) | Sorrow | Mourning (historical) |
| Green | Nature, luck, envy | Exorcism, disgrace | Islam | Growth |
| Yellow | Happiness, hazards | Royalty | Merchant/farmer | Courage |
| Blue | Trust, calm, masculinity | N/A | Krishna (blue skin) | Calm |
| Black | Mourning, elegance | For little boys | Power | Unhappiness |

### The invisible communication stack

From most immediately perceived to most gradually absorbed:

1. Colour (first impression, visceral)
2. Imagery (emotional connection)
3. Typeface (personality signal)
4. Icons and symbols (functional guidance)
5. Tone of voice (relationship formation)
6. Brand consistency (trust and recognition over time)

Each layer reinforces the others. Conflict at any layer undermines the whole.

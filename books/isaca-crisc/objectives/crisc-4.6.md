# 4.6: Emerging technologies (AI/LLM, quantum computing, Zero Trust)

Source: ISACA Certified in Risk and Information Systems Control (CRISC) Exam Guide

## Key concepts

- **Emerging technology risk**: Risk of negative or adverse impact from
  implementing new technology that has not been fully adopted in the industry
  - Risk managers must stay abreast of technological innovations to support
    business decisions
  - Balance between technical revolution and safe, responsible deployment

- **Artificial intelligence (AI)**: Science of developing intelligent machines
  that perform tasks typically requiring human intervention
  - Current applications: autonomous vehicles, customer service chatbots, fraud
    detection systems
  - GPT-4 referenced as revolutionary advancement in AI industry
  - Key risk areas: data privacy and security, algorithmic bias, transparency
    and explainability to humans
  - Potential to transform healthcare, finance, and transportation through
    efficiency and accuracy gains

- **Quantum computing**: Nascent discipline leveraging quantum mechanics
  principles for computation
  - Uses quantum bits (qubits) that exist in superposition of multiple states
    simultaneously
  - Qubits can be entangled to perform intricate computations faster than
    classical computing
  - Primary risk: potential to decrypt current encryption methods
  - Cryptography is the most significant impact area for quantum computing

- **Blockchain**: Distributed ledger technology enabling secure, transparent
  transactions without intermediaries
  - Originally developed for cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin)
  - Expanding to healthcare, supply chain management, finance
  - Challenges: scalability, energy consumption, regulatory uncertainty

- **Internet of Things (IoT)**: Devices with sensors and software collecting and
  transmitting data over the internet
  - Enables real-time monitoring and control without human intervention
  - Privacy concerns: incidents with Amazon Alexa, Google Nest
  - Vulnerable to cyber-attacks; collected data often sensitive and personal

- **Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)**: Policy allowing employees to use personal
  devices for company resources
  - Benefits: flexibility, convenience, cost savings, productivity
  - Risks: data protection, security when accessing from personal devices
  - Required controls: policies, technical controls, employee training

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Organization adopting AI for customer service | Assess data privacy, bias prevention, transparency requirements before deployment | AI risks include biased algorithms and opaque decision-making |
| Evaluating quantum-resistant cryptography | Plan migration strategy for encryption methods | Quantum computing threatens current encryption algorithms |
| Implementing IoT sensors in manufacturing | Prioritize data privacy and security measures | IoT devices are vulnerable to attacks and collect sensitive data |
| BYOD policy implementation | Build policies, technical controls, and training program | Personal devices accessing company data require security controls |
| Blockchain for supply chain | Address scalability, energy, and regulatory concerns | Technology is early-stage with unresolved operational challenges |

## Gotchas

- **Quantum computing will not break all cryptography immediately**: The
  technology is nascent; risk managers should plan for gradual migration to
  quantum-resistant algorithms rather than panic
- **AI transparency is a requirement, not optional**: Ensuring AI is
  understandable to humans is critical for responsible deployment, not just a
  nice-to-have
- **BYOD is not just a technical problem**: Requires organizational policies and
  employee training, not just technical controls
- **Emerging technology risk differs from infrastructure risk**: Emerging
  technology risk relates to unproven adoption, while infrastructure risk
  relates to support capacity for business needs

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| CRISC Domain 4 weight | 20% | Information Technology and Security |
| AI risk categories | 3 | Privacy/security, bias, transparency |
| Quantum computing threat | Encryption | Can potentially decrypt current algorithms |
| BYOD control areas | 3 | Policies, technical controls, training |

## Related topics

- **Cryptography and encryption**: Quantum computing directly threatens current
  symmetric and asymmetric encryption methods; AES-256 and RSA are vulnerable to
  future quantum attacks
- **Data privacy principles**: AI and IoT both raise significant privacy
  concerns requiring privacy-by-design approaches
- **Control frameworks**: Emerging technologies require compensating controls
  when traditional controls are insufficient
- **Risk assessment**: Emerging technology risk is a distinct risk category in
  IT risk catalogs requiring specific evaluation criteria
- **System Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**: Emerging technologies should be
  evaluated during the initiation and design phases for security implications

## Exam-critical points

1. Quantum computing can break current encryption algorithms - this is the
   primary security concern
2. AI challenges include: data privacy, algorithmic bias, and transparency
3. BYOD requires three control types: policies, technical controls, and training
4. IoT devices are vulnerable to cyber-attacks and raise privacy concerns
5. Blockchain challenges: scalability, energy consumption, regulatory
   uncertainty
6. Risk managers must stay current on emerging technologies to advise business
   decisions
7. Emerging technology risk is the risk of adverse impact from implementing
   unproven technology

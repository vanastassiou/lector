# 2.7: Collaborate on risk awareness program and training for stakeholders

Source: ISACA Certified in Risk and Information Systems Control (CRISC) Exam Guide

## Key concepts

- **Security awareness training**: A critical component of any cybersecurity
  strategy that educates employees on identifying and mitigating potential
  security risks and promotes a culture of security throughout the organization.
  - According to Verizon's 2022 Data Breach Investigations Report, 82% of
    breaches involved the human element (stolen credentials, phishing, misuse,
    or error).
  - Best control against insider threats is preventive: training combined with
    developing a security-conscious culture.

- **Risk culture**: The organizational attitude toward risk management,
  directly impacting employee behavior and policy adherence.
  - Five maturity levels: Vulnerable, Reactive, Compliant, Proactive, Resilient.
  - Nothing impacts organizational behavior toward risk more than its culture;
    nothing impacts culture more than senior management.
  - Resilient organizations have clear accountabilities established and
    communicated throughout, emphasizing risk management in everything they do.

- **Stakeholder collaboration**: Risk awareness requires participation from all
  business functions.
  - Second Line of Defense (risk and compliance functions) is responsible for
    communicating the risk management framework across the organization and
    obtaining buy-in from key stakeholders.
  - KRIs (Key Risk Indicators) should be actionable and reported to stakeholders
    to drive informed decision-making.
  - Reports and dashboards must be tailored to the audience's role and
    preferred format.

- **Training timing and frequency**:
  - Ideally within 30 days of onboarding.
  - At least annually thereafter.
  - Role-based and privileged user training in addition to general staff
    awareness training.

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Employees falling for phishing attacks | Implement security awareness training focused on social engineering recognition | Social engineering exploits human behavior; training helps employees recognize and resist manipulation tactics |
| New data classification policy rollout | Conduct security awareness training for employees | Ensures employees understand the policy and can implement it properly |
| Mobile device risks in workforce | Combine MDM solution with security awareness training | Training alone is insufficient; technical controls plus awareness provide defense in depth |
| Building security culture | Obtain senior management sponsorship and visible support | No amount of training works if risk emphasis is not communicated from the top |
| Ensuring consistent security controls | Develop and enforce policies with training programs | Policies provide framework; training ensures understanding and consistent implementation |

## Gotchas

- **Training alone eliminates incidents**: Security awareness training reduces
  risk but cannot eliminate all security incidents. The goal is risk reduction,
  not elimination.

- **Technical controls replace training**: The best protection against internal
  threats is not tools or access restrictions but continuous education and
  upskilling of employees.

- **Risk manager determines all training content**: Business owners are the best
  assessors of what is critical to their operations. Risk practitioners
  collaborate with them to determine appropriate training content.

- **One-size-fits-all reporting**: Different stakeholders need different
  reporting formats. Tailor reports to the audience -- executives may need
  dashboards while operational teams need detailed metrics.

- **KRIs without actionability**: KRIs reported to stakeholders that are not
  actionable provide little value to senior management. All indicators should
  drive specific decisions or actions.

## Key indicators for awareness programs

| Indicator type | Definition | Example |
| -------------- | ---------- | ------- |
| KPI (Key Performance Indicator) | Measures control performance | Reduction in phishing emails after implementing new tool |
| KRI (Key Risk Indicator) | Predicts risks that could breach thresholds | Group of employees not trained in security awareness and continuing to fall for phishing |
| KCI (Key Control Indicator) | Measures effectiveness of controls | Lack of implemented controls to block phishing emails |

## Training program objectives

| Objective | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Primary goal | Develop a security-conscious culture across the organization |
| Risk reduction | Reduce the likelihood of data breaches and security incidents |
| Social engineering defense | Help employees recognize and resist manipulation tactics |
| Policy compliance | Ensure employees understand and can implement security policies |
| Incident reporting | Enable employees to be proactive in reporting suspicious activities |

- **Organizational culture**: Risk culture maturity directly determines training
  effectiveness and employee adoption of security practices.
- **Three Lines of Defense**: Second LoD develops KRIs and keeps stakeholders
  informed of threats; first LoD implements training within their business units.
- **Risk reporting**: Dashboards, heat maps, and scorecards communicate training
  effectiveness and risk posture to stakeholders.
- **CISO responsibilities**: Ensuring all employees are trained on security
  awareness and best practices is a core CISO function.
- **Business continuity management**: Regular employee training and awareness
  programs are essential components ensuring employees understand their roles
  during disruptions.

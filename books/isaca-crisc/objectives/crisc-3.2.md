# 3.2: Assist risk owners in developing risk action plans

Source: ISACA Certified in Risk and Information Systems Control (CRISC) Exam Guide

## Key concepts

- **Risk action plan**: A documented response strategy that outlines how an
  organization will address identified risks through specific controls,
  timelines, and accountable parties. Also referred to as a corrective action
  plan (CAP) or risk treatment plan.

- **Risk owner**: A manager or executive committee member accountable for a
  specific risk, with authority to provide budget, mandate responses, and
  accept residual risk.
  - Each risk should have a single risk owner
  - The risk owner provides resources and expertise to remediate risks
  - Owns the loss incurred if the risk scenario materializes
  - Must be recorded in the risk register

- **Control owner**: The individual responsible for implementing or overseeing
  the effectiveness of a specific control.
  - May differ from the risk owner to maintain segregation of duties
  - In smaller organizations, the same person may serve both roles
  - Should be documented in the risk register once identified

- **Risk response strategies**: The four methods for addressing risk:
  - Mitigate: Implement countermeasures and controls; cost must be less than
    effective risk
  - Accept: Document the decision when cost of treatment exceeds benefit;
    requires management sign-off
  - Transfer/Share: Assign risk through insurance or outsourcing; suited for
    low likelihood/high impact risks
  - Avoid: Terminate the risk source entirely; irreversible, requires senior
    management approval

- **Corrective action plan (CAP)**: Created when risks cannot be remediated
  immediately; must include an owner, timeline for remediation, and specific
  corrective actions.

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Risk impacts multiple business units | Assign owner who can provide budget and expertise | Single accountability prevents gaps |
| Cost of mitigation exceeds asset value | Document risk acceptance with management sign-off | Cost-benefit analysis drives response |
| Critical vendor has control deficiencies | Create CAP with agreed timelines and senior management sign-off | Formalizes remediation commitment |
| Risk cannot be addressed within tolerance | Propose risk avoidance to senior management | Last resort when other strategies fail |

## Gotchas

- **"Treat" is not a response strategy**: Risk response and risk treat are used
  interchangeably in conversation, but only mitigate/accept/transfer/avoid are
  formal response strategies.

- **Response selection is not one-size-fits-all**: Organizations may combine
  multiple strategies to optimize a single risk.

- **Risk acceptance can exceed appetite but not capacity**: Accepting risk
  above tolerance requires executive approval; exceeding capacity threatens
  organizational existence.

- **Reputational damage does not transfer**: Insurance or outsourcing provides
  monetary indemnity, but reputational harm remains with the organization.

- **Annual review is mandatory**: Accepted risks must be reassessed at least
  annually to determine if the response remains appropriate.

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Minimum CAP review frequency | Annual | Revisit accepted risks yearly |
| Risk register required fields | Threat, vulnerability, likelihood, impact, inherent risk, controls, residual risk, countermeasures, owner | Minimum data elements |
| Response selection factors | 11 | Category, cost, availability, skillsets, complexity, resources, alignment, compatibility, contractual, legal/regulatory requirements |

## Related topics

- **Cost-benefit analysis**: Required component of the business case for any
  risk response; includes return-on-investment thesis.

- **Risk register**: Central repository where risk owners, control owners,
  response strategies, and CAPs are documented.

- **Three lines of defense (3LoD)**: First line (business owners) are ultimate
  risk owners; risk practitioners assist but do not own the risk.

- **Risk optimization**: The goal of response is not elimination but
  optimization to acceptable levels aligned with organizational strategy.

- **Risk reporting**: Business case presentations to senior management must
  clearly show risks and control implementation strategy to obtain approval.

# 2.1: Collect and analyze documentation about internal and external environments

Source: CRISC Certified in Risk and Information Systems Control All-in-One Exam Guide

## Key concepts

- **IT risk identification**: First step in the risk management life cycle.
  Requires understanding the technologies used in the organization and the
  development, acquisition, implementation, integration, and sunset processes
  for those technologies. An organization can only assess and treat risks it
  knows exist.
- **Internal environment documentation**: Encompasses organizational structure,
  culture, policies, standards, procedures, guidelines, and asset inventories.
  Provides context for how the organization operates and manages risk.
- **External environment documentation**: Includes regulatory requirements,
  threat landscape data, vendor/third-party assessments, industry frameworks,
  and market conditions. Informs risk scenarios driven by factors outside the
  organization's direct control.
- **Risk profile**: The overall risk exposure of an organization. Impacted by
  new regulations, technology changes, business objective shifts, mergers and
  acquisitions, and competitor activity. IT risk profile specifically captures
  identified IT risk exposure, including emerging threats, malicious actors,
  incidents, privacy frameworks, acquired assets, and supply chain risks.
- **Top-down risk assessment**: Driven from management perspective, focused on
  risks that directly impact business objectives. Provides broader strategic
  view but may overlook operational details.
- **Bottom-up risk assessment**: Identified by individuals and teams, then
  cascaded to department and organization level. Captures granular
  process-related risks but requires complex coordination.

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| New EHR system implementation | Collect Board of Directors revenue reviews, Ethics & Compliance regulatory reports, senior management performance data, security reports | Multiple stakeholder perspectives ensure comprehensive risk identification across strategic, regulatory, and operational dimensions |
| Disagreement between business manager and security manager on vendor risk | Escalate to senior management with documented pros and cons for final input and risk acceptance | Major vendor decisions require executive judgment when risk assessment results are contested |
| First risk assessment at organization | Start with qualitative methodology, leverage industry risk catalogs to baseline | Quantitative techniques like FAIR require historical data and mature processes; checklists and qualitative ratings enable rapid program initiation |
| Assessing supplier-related risks | Review NIST SP 800-161 for supply chain guidance, identify vendor risk management strategy, assess fourth-party risks | Supply chain risks extend beyond direct vendors to their dependencies |

## Gotchas

- **Risk register is not optional**: All identified risks must be entered into a
  risk register. Minimum fields: threats, vulnerabilities, likelihood, impact,
  inherent risk, current controls, residual risk, countermeasures, risk owner.
- **Both approaches needed**: Best results require combining top-down and
  bottom-up risk assessment. Neither alone provides complete coverage.
- **Culture trumps process**: Senior management sponsorship and organizational
  culture toward risk are the primary determinants of risk management program
  success. Documentation quality follows cultural commitment.
- **Policies are business decisions**: Technology determines how policies are
  implemented, not what they require. Policy documentation (policies, standards,
  procedures, guidelines) forms the foundation for control implementation.
- **Asset identification precedes protection**: "You can't protect what you
  don't know exists." Asset inventories covering people, technology, data, and
  intellectual property are prerequisites for meaningful risk assessment.

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Risk assessment frequency | At least annually | More frequent (quarterly) assessments acceptable; many regulations require periodic assessment but do not specify frequency |
| Policy review cycle | Annually or after major change | Major business process or infrastructure changes trigger review |
| Exception review | Annually | Logged exceptions should be reviewed to remove those no longer required |
| CRISC Domain 2 weight | 20% | Approximately 30 questions on the exam |

- **Three Lines of Defense**: Establishes accountability structure for risk
  management; first line (operations), second line (risk management/compliance),
  third line (internal audit)
- **Business Impact Analysis (BIA)**: Identifies critical business processes and
  recovery priorities (RPO, RTO, MTD); complements risk assessment by focusing
  on recovery rather than threat identification
- **Threat modeling**: PASTA, STRIDE, and other methodologies for systematic
  threat identification; informs external environment analysis
- **RACI model**: Defines Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed roles;
  essential for documenting risk management responsibilities
- **Industry frameworks**: NIST SP 800-30/37/161, ISO 27005, ISO 31000, OCTAVE,
  FAIR provide structured approaches to documentation and analysis

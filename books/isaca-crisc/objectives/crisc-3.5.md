# 3.5: Support control owners in establishing procedures and documentation

Source: ISACA Certified in Risk and Information Systems Control (CRISC) Exam Guide

## Key concepts

- **Control owner**: The person who implements a control to mitigate risk or
  oversees control effectiveness
  - Must be identified and recorded in the risk register
  - Responsible for determining efficacy of controls periodically
  - May be the same person as the risk owner in small organizations, though
    segregation of duties is preferred
  - Unlike risk owners, control owners are often identified after the initial
    risk assessment

- **Policy documentation hierarchy**: The structured relationship between
  governance documents
  - **Policies**: High-level statements of management intent; business
    decisions, not technical ones
  - **Standards**: Mandatory requirements for processes, actions, and
    configurations that satisfy control objectives
  - **Procedures**: Documented steps to perform tasks in conformance with
    standards; also called Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
  - **Guidelines**: Recommended practices allowing discretion in implementation

- **Procedures**: Critical documentation owned by process owners/asset
  custodians
  - Address how the organization operationalizes a policy, standard, or control
  - Provide defendable evidence of due care practices
  - Must include stakeholder oversight for compliance requirements
  - Should be maintained as living documents

- **RACI model**: Framework for establishing clear accountability
  - **Responsible**: Individual/team performing the work
  - **Accountable**: Individual ensuring success by providing resources
  - **Consulted**: Subject matter experts with domain knowledge
  - **Informed**: Stakeholders affected by success or failure

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| New control without documented procedures | Control owner develops SOPs with stakeholder oversight | Procedures provide evidence of due care and ensure consistent execution |
| Encryption policy implementation | Create standard (algorithm requirements), then procedure (step-by-step guidance) | Hierarchy ensures technical specifics support policy intent |
| Control owner and risk owner are the same person | Document justification; implement compensating oversight | Common in small organizations but weakens segregation of duties |
| Control gaps identified after implementation | Document in risk register; advise risk owner | Control owner responsible for ongoing efficacy evaluation |
| Policy exception required for business need | Raise exception, obtain explicit approval from business process owner, log centrally | Enables business while maintaining documented accountability |

## Gotchas

- **Control owners identified too late**: Unlike risk owners, control owners
  are often not identified during risk assessment; record them in the risk
  register as soon as identified

- **Procedures without stakeholder oversight**: Procedures built by process
  owners alone may miss compliance requirements; include stakeholder review

- **Confusing accountability with responsibility**: The accountable party
  provides resources and approves decisions; the responsible party executes the
  work

- **Static documentation**: Post-implementation review documents and procedures
  should be living documents, updated as new learnings emerge

- **Exception management failures**: Exceptions must be logged centrally and
  reviewed annually; undocumented exceptions create compliance gaps

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Exception review frequency | Annual minimum | More frequent for high-risk areas |
| Control testing approach | Progressive or regressive | Progressive starts from requirements; regressive works backward from results |
| Post-implementation review timing | After each major implementation | Regardless of success or failure |
| Risk register updates | Immediate for control owner changes | Document control owner as soon as identified |

## Related topics

- **Control testing and evaluation**: Control owners determine efficacy through
  testing; risk practitioners advise risk owners on gaps
- **Exception management**: Formal process for policy deviations with approval,
  logging, and annual review
- **Risk and control monitoring**: Continuous process to ensure controls remain
  adequate as threat landscape changes
- **Key Control Indicators (KCIs)**: Metrics measuring control effectiveness to
  indicate weakness that may increase risk probability
- **Post-implementation reviews**: Document lessons learned and disseminate to
  stakeholders; questions should cover business objectives, user requirements,
  and resource allocation

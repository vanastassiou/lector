# 2.5: Create and maintain IT risk register with recognized risk scenarios

Source: ISACA Certified in Risk and Information Systems Control (CRISC) Exam Guide

## Key concepts

- **Risk register**: Central repository for documenting all identified risks
  from risk assessments. Can be a sophisticated SaaS tool or a simple
  spreadsheet.
  - At minimum contains: threats, vulnerabilities, likelihood, impact, inherent
    risk, current controls, residual risk, countermeasures, and risk owner
  - Serves as a live document updated when risks change due to internal or
    external factors
  - The immediate result of a risk assessment

- **Risk scenario**: A description of a potential risk event with its causes
  and consequences
  - Top-down approach: Scenarios driven from management perspective, tied
    directly to business objectives
  - Bottom-up approach: Scenarios identified by individuals and teams,
    cascaded up to department, business unit, and organization level
  - Best practice: combine both approaches to address strategic and
    operational risks

- **Risk owner**: Manager or executive accountable for a specific risk
  - Provides budget, resources, and mandate for risk response
  - Each risk requires exactly one owner
  - When risk impacts multiple business units, owner should be the leader who
    can provide budget and expertise
  - Owns the loss incurred if the risk scenario materializes

- **Control owner**: Person who implements or oversees control effectiveness
  - May be different from risk owner to maintain segregation of duties
  - Smaller organizations may assign both roles to one person
  - Must be recorded in the risk register once identified

- **Corrective action plan (CAP)**: Created when a risk cannot be remediated
  immediately
  - Must include: owner, remediation timeline, specific corrective actions
  - Closed when remediation is implemented and risk marked as remediated

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| New risk identified in assessment | Enter into risk register with all required fields | Ensures tracking and accountability |
| Risk impacts multiple business units | Assign owner who controls budget and resources | Single point of accountability needed |
| Risk cannot be remediated immediately | Create CAP with owner, timeline, and actions | Documents commitment to future remediation |
| Risk environment changes | Update risk register to reflect new likelihood/impact | Register must remain current |
| Control owner unclear at assessment time | Note in register when identified | Control owner may emerge during implementation |

## Gotchas

- **Not all risks have equal priority**: Risk practitioner must dedicate time
  to prioritize which risks require immediate remediation versus later review.
  Discuss likelihood and impact with stakeholders during assessment.

- **Risk register scope limitation**: A risk register does not provide a
  comprehensive view of all organizational risks. Emerging risks or risks not
  yet identified may be absent. Register may cover only specific projects or
  initiatives.

- **Confusing risk owner with control owner**: Risk owner is accountable for
  the risk and approves response strategy. Control owner is responsible for
  implementing and maintaining specific controls.

- **Treating register as static**: The risk register must be a live document.
  Failing to update when internal or external factors change leads to
  inaccurate risk posture.

- **Omitting countermeasures**: Register should include future countermeasures
  that will reduce risk, not just current controls.

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Minimum risk register fields | 8 | Threats, vulnerabilities, likelihood, impact, inherent risk, controls, residual risk, risk owner |
| Risk owners per risk | 1 | Single point of accountability required |
| CAP components | 3 | Owner, timeline, corrective actions |

## Types of risk in register

| Risk type | Definition | Use |
| --------- | ---------- | --- |
| Inherent risk | Risk level without considering controls | Baseline risk before mitigation |
| Residual risk | Risk remaining after controls implemented | Inherent risk minus control effectiveness |
| Current risk | Point-in-time risk at any given moment | Fluctuates based on threat landscape |

Formula: `Residual Risk = Inherent Risk - Implemented Controls`

## Related topics

- **Risk assessment approaches**: Top-down and bottom-up methods inform which
  scenarios enter the register
- **Risk response strategies**: Mitigate, accept, transfer, avoid - documented
  in register as risk treatment decisions
- **Three lines of defense**: First line owns business risks, informs
  accountability model for risk ownership
- **Qualitative vs quantitative analysis**: Determines how likelihood and
  impact values are expressed in the register

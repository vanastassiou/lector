# 1.6: Facilitate identification of risk appetite and tolerance by key stakeholders

Source: ISACA Certified in Risk and Information Systems Control (CRISC) Exam Guide

## Key concepts

- **Risk appetite**: The amount of risk an organization is willing to accept to
  achieve its objectives
  - Represents strategic-level risk acceptance boundaries
  - Must be agreed upon with relevant stakeholders
  - Translates into standards and policies that contain risk within defined
    boundaries
  - Requires regular adjustment as business conditions change

- **Risk tolerance**: The acceptable level of variation that management is
  willing to allow to achieve its objectives
  - Represents a slight deviation from acceptable risk levels
  - Provides operational flexibility within appetite boundaries
  - Going beyond appetite but within tolerance is manageable with compensating
    controls

- **Risk capacity**: The amount of risk an organization can afford to take
  without its continued existence being called into question
  - Represents the absolute upper limit of risk exposure
  - Breaching capacity threatens organizational survival
  - Risk appetite and tolerance must always remain below capacity

- **Risk profile**: The overall risk exposure of the organization to any type
  of risk
  - Factors affecting profile: regulations, technology changes, business
    objectives, mergers/acquisitions, competitors
  - IT risk profile: overall identified IT risk exposure including emerging
    threats, malicious actors, incidents, regulatory changes

## Key stakeholder roles

- **Board of directors**: Risk owners who set strategic direction and approve
  risk appetite
- **Senior management**: Risk practitioners who operationalize appetite into
  policies
- **Business owners**: First line of defense; own both business processes and
  associated risks
- **Risk manager**: Proposes risk responses to stakeholders and ensures
  alignment with appetite
- **Executive sponsors** (CRO, CISO, CFO, CEO): Provide program sponsorship and
  wider organizational/industry perspective

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Setting initial risk appetite | Obtain agreement from relevant stakeholders; translate into standards and policies | Ensures buy-in and operationalizes appetite into enforceable controls |
| Risk exceeds appetite but within tolerance | Document compensating controls; obtain formal sign-off | Tolerance allows controlled deviation when properly managed |
| Risk approaches capacity threshold | Escalate immediately to senior management | Breaching capacity threatens organizational existence |
| Business conditions change | Regularly review and adjust appetite boundaries | Static appetite becomes misaligned with evolving objectives |
| Risk acceptance request | Document risk owner, countermeasures, duration, executive sign-off | Formal process ensures accountability and stakeholder alignment |

## Gotchas

- **Tolerance and capacity are not interchangeable**: Practitioners often
  conflate these terms; tolerance is acceptable variation, capacity is survival
  threshold
- **Risk acceptance can exceed appetite**: Acceptance may go beyond appetite
  and tolerance but must never exceed capacity
- **Appetite must align with business objectives**: High-risk areas providing
  more value should receive more resources than low-risk, low-reward processes
- **Senior management defines, not just approves**: Risk appetite and tolerance
  must be defined, approved, and clearly communicated by senior management
- **Exception process required**: Organizations need formal processes to review
  and approve exceptions to stated appetite levels

## Facilitation process

1. Engage key stakeholders (board, executives, business owners)
2. Define risk appetite aligned with business objectives
3. Establish tolerance thresholds and capacity limits
4. Translate appetite into policies, standards, and procedures
5. Communicate framework across the organization
6. Obtain buy-in from key stakeholders
7. Implement formal exception and risk acceptance process
8. Review and adjust boundaries as conditions change

## Documentation requirements

Risk acceptance documentation must include:
- Risk owner (business owner) accepting the risk
- Countermeasures to reduce risk in the future
- Duration of risk acceptance
- Final sign-off from executive team
- Confirmation that all relevant teams and stakeholders are aligned

## Related topics

- **Three lines of defense**: Provides framework for risk ownership and
  accountability; first line owns risk, second line provides oversight
- **Risk register**: Must include risk owner and document appetite alignment
- **KRIs**: Should be actionable and enable monitoring of risk against appetite
  thresholds
- **Risk response strategies**: Mitigation, acceptance, transfer, and avoidance
  must align with stated appetite
- **Enterprise risk management**: Risk appetite is foundational to the ERM
  framework

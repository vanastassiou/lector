# 2.4: Identify key stakeholders for IT risk scenarios to establish accountability

Source: ISACA Certified in Risk and Information Systems Control (CRISC) Exam Guide

## Key concepts

- **Stakeholder**: An individual or group affected by or having influence over
  organizational risk decisions. Stakeholders include board members, senior
  executives, business owners, risk practitioners, and external parties such as
  regulators.

- **Accountability**: The obligation to answer for risk outcomes. Accountability
  ensures a dedicated individual can be reached to approve risk response
  strategies and owns the loss if a risk scenario materializes.

- **Risk owner**: The individual accountable for a specific risk. The risk owner
  provides budget and resources, mandates risk response, and is recorded in the
  risk register. There should be a single risk owner per risk to avoid diluted
  responsibility.

- **Control owner**: The person who implements or oversees the effectiveness of
  a control. Unlike risk owners, control owners may not be identifiable at risk
  assessment time but should be documented once identified.

- **RACI model**: A tool for assigning roles and responsibilities:
  - Responsible: performs the risk management work
  - Accountable: provides resources and owns project success
  - Consulted: subject matter experts with domain knowledge
  - Informed: affected by outcomes but not directly involved

- **Three Lines of Defense (3LoD)**: Framework that segregates duties and
  establishes clear accountability:
  - First line (operational management): business owners who are ultimate risk
    owners, implement controls, and maintain day-to-day risk management
  - Second line (risk and compliance): develops frameworks, monitors first line,
    communicates KRIs to stakeholders
  - Third line (audit): provides independent assurance on first and second line
    effectiveness

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Risk impacts multiple business units | Assign owner who controls budget and resources for remediation | Single point of accountability prevents gaps |
| Risk owner and control owner are same person | Accept in small organizations but document segregation concern | Maintains visibility into potential conflict |
| New risk identified during assessment | Record risk owner in register immediately | Ensures accountability from identification through response |
| Business owner leaves organization | Reassign risk ownership before departure | Prevents orphaned risks without accountable party |
| Stakeholders disagree on risk response | Escalate to accountable party (e.g., CISO, executive sponsor) | Accountable role has authority to decide |

## Gotchas

- **Confusing responsible with accountable**: Responsible parties perform the
  work; accountable parties own outcomes and provide resources. A risk manager
  is responsible for conducting assessments but the CISO is accountable for the
  program's success.

- **Multiple risk owners**: Each risk should have exactly one owner. When
  multiple business units are affected, select the leader who can provide budget
  and expertise for remediation.

- **Skipping the Informed role**: Board members and executives may not be
  directly involved but need visibility into risk status. Failing to keep them
  informed undermines governance oversight.

- **Orphan accounts analogy**: Just as database accounts without owners create
  security gaps, risks without designated owners go unaddressed. The 3LoD
  example of orphan accounts illustrates how accountability failures cascade
  across all three lines.

- **Governance vs. management confusion**: Governance (board/stakeholders) sets
  direction and provides oversight. Management (risk practitioners) executes.
  Stakeholder identification must respect this separation.

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Risk owners per risk | 1 | Single point of accountability |
| RACI accountable parties | 1 per activity | Only one person can be accountable |
| Minimum stakeholder roles | 4 (RACI) | Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed |
| Lines of defense | 3 | Operational, Risk/Compliance, Audit |
| Risk register required fields | Owner + Control owner | Both must be documented |

## Related topics

- **Risk register maintenance**: Stakeholder assignments are recorded in the
  risk register along with threats, vulnerabilities, and response strategies.

- **Three lines of defense**: Provides the structural framework for stakeholder
  accountability across operational, oversight, and assurance functions.

- **Risk appetite**: Stakeholders (board, executives) define acceptable risk
  levels that guide response decisions.

- **IT governance**: Establishes accountability for aligning IT investments with
  business objectives and generating stakeholder value.

- **Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)**: Second line develops KRIs and reports to
  stakeholders; effectiveness depends on actionability and audience relevance.

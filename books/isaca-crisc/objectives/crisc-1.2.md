# 1.2: Identify potential or realized impacts of IT risk on business objectives

Source: ISACA Certified in Risk and Information Systems Control (CRISC) Exam Guide

## Key concepts

- **IT risk categories**: IT risk impacts business objectives through three primary
  channels:
  - IT value enablement risk: delivered projects fail to create expected value,
    causing loss of shareholder value and missed opportunities
  - IT program and project delivery risk: projects not delivered as agreed, leading
    to strategic misalignment with stakeholders
  - IT operations and service delivery risk: services fail to meet SLAs, disrupting
    business operations

- **Risk measurement principle**: IT risk must be measured by its impact on IT
  services and the business operations those services support
  - IT risk is a subset of enterprise risk
  - Impact assessment considers effects on confidentiality, integrity, and
    availability

- **Impact on business objectives**: Risk management efforts must align with business
  objectives to obtain senior management sponsorship
  - Steering committees with cross-functional participants focus on high-risk areas
    that adversely impact business objectives
  - Risk scenarios in top-down assessments are developed for events that directly
    impact business goals

- **Tangible vs. intangible impacts**: IT risks affect both asset types:
  - Tangible: equipment, physical media, infrastructure
  - Intangible: data, knowledge, reputation, intellectual property, people
  - Loss of intangible assets (e.g., competitive advantage from IP theft) can exceed
    tangible losses

- **Enterprise risk context**: IT risk feeds into broader enterprise risk categories:
  - Strategic risk, operational risk, compliance risk, reputational risk, market risk,
    credit risk, environmental risk

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Data leakage via email causing reputational damage | Trace through risk lifecycle: identify, categorize, assess impact, respond, report, monitor | Links IT control failure to business impact |
| New EHR system implementation | Top-down: BoD reviews strategic/revenue impact; bottom-up: departments assess operational impact | Combines strategic and operational impact views |
| Vendor fails to meet SLA | Assess cascading effects on dependent business processes | Third-party risk translates to service delivery risk |
| Key resource leaves organization | Evaluate talent risk impact on knowledge continuity and business operations | People are organizational assets; loss creates operational gaps |

## Gotchas

- **IT risk is not isolated**: IT risk impacts enterprise-level objectives and must be
  communicated in business terms, not technical jargon
- **Impact is not just financial**: Includes regulatory penalties, reputational damage,
  operational disruption, and loss of competitive advantage
- **Realized vs. potential**: A realized risk is one that has materialized and caused
  actual loss; potential risk requires assessment of likelihood and impact before
  occurrence
- **BIA vs. risk assessment**: BIA focuses on recovery priorities after disruption;
  risk assessment identifies threats and impacts before they materialize
- **Risk ownership confusion**: Without a designated risk owner, impacts may go
  unnoticed; the risk owner bears accountability for realized losses

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Risk assessment frequency | Quarterly to annually | At minimum, annual assessment required |
| RPO/RTO/MTD | Business-defined | BIA outputs that quantify acceptable impact thresholds |
| Risk register contents | Threat, vulnerability, likelihood, impact, inherent risk, controls, residual risk, owner | Minimum required fields |
| Corrective action plan (CAP) | Owner, timeline, remediation actions | Required when risk cannot be immediately remediated |

## Related topics

- **Business Impact Analysis (BIA)**: Determines RPO, RTO, and MTD to quantify
  acceptable downtime and data loss -- directly measures impact tolerance
- **Risk register**: Documents identified risks with impact ratings and owners;
  central record for tracking realized and potential impacts
- **Qualitative vs. quantitative analysis**: Qualitative uses High/Medium/Low impact
  ratings; quantitative assigns monetary values to potential losses
- **Risk response strategies**: Mitigate, accept, transfer, or avoid -- selection
  depends on impact severity relative to risk appetite
- **Top-down and bottom-up assessment**: Top-down captures strategic impacts to
  business objectives; bottom-up captures operational and process-level impacts

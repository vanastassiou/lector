# 1.1: Collect and review information about business and IT environments

Source: ISACA Certified in Risk and Information Systems Control (CRISC) Exam Guide

## Key concepts

- **Governance of Enterprise IT (GEIT)**: Leverages technology to support and
  optimize enterprise needs
  - Addresses applicable laws, regulations, and compliance
  - Ensures IT investments align with business objectives
  - Promotes stakeholder value generation
  - Value generated through: benefit realization, risk optimization, resource
    optimization

- **Enterprise Architecture (EA)**: Foundation for running any business
  effectively
  - **Business architecture**: Captures how the business operates; defines
    processes in organizational context
  - **Application architecture**: Defines software solutions enabling business
    objectives
  - **Data architecture**: Models for working with different data sources and
    formats
  - **Technology architecture**: Underlying infrastructure (hardware, software,
    networks, storage) needed to run business applications
  - Common frameworks: TOGAF, Zachman, DODAF, FEAF, SABSA

- **Risk Profile**: Overall risk exposure of the organization
  - Enterprise factors: regulations, technology changes, business objectives,
    mergers and acquisitions, competitors
  - IT risk factors: emerging threats, malicious actors, incidents, privacy
    frameworks, new/acquired assets, supply chain risks
  - Requires actionable Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) for monitoring

- **Risk Appetite, Tolerance, and Capacity**:
  - **Risk appetite**: Amount of risk willing to accept to achieve objectives
  - **Risk tolerance**: Acceptable variation from risk appetite
  - **Risk capacity**: Maximum risk before threatening organizational existence
  - Hierarchy: appetite ≤ tolerance < capacity

- **Organizational structure**: Defines roles, responsibilities, and
  accountability
  - Board of directors provides oversight and direction
  - Management executes and implements governance decisions
  - IT risk manager must understand Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) structure
  - RACI model assigns roles for projects

- **RACI Model**: Tool for determining project responsibilities
  - **Responsible**: Individual/team performing the work
  - **Accountable**: Provides resources; answerable for success
  - **Consulted**: Subject matter experts and business process owners
  - **Informed**: Stakeholders affected by success or failure

- **Organizational culture**: Determines behavior toward risk management
  - **Vulnerable**: Response only after risk materializes
  - **Reactive**: Response based on complaints or compliance requirements
  - **Compliant**: Responsibilities defined; driven by external requirements
  - **Proactive**: Senior management informed; provides sponsorship
  - **Resilient**: Clear accountability; risk management in everything

- **Organizational assets**: Anything providing value to the organization
  - **People**: Greatest asset; vulnerable to loss of key expertise
  - **Technology**: Outdated systems increase malware and patch risk
  - **Data**: Requires classification; controls proportional to value
  - **Intellectual property**: Trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets

- **Policy documentation hierarchy**: Translates strategy into action
  - **Policies**: High-level management intent (business decisions)
  - **Standards**: Mandatory requirements satisfying control objectives
  - **Procedures**: Documented steps for specific tasks (SOPs)
  - **Guidelines**: Recommended practices allowing discretion

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| New risk manager joining organization | Understand culture and sponsorship first | Culture determines how risk management will be received |
| Assessing IT risk for first time | Identify and inventory assets | "You can't protect what you don't know exists" |
| Determining control requirements | Classify data and value assets | Controls should be proportional to asset value |
| Building risk program without support | Obtain senior management sponsorship | Without sponsorship, budget and legitimacy are insufficient |
| Multiple stakeholders with unclear roles | Implement RACI matrix | Clarifies responsibilities with varying priorities |
| Major IT investment | Risk practitioners provide accurate, timely information | Enables well-informed decisions with due diligence |
| Aligning risk with business objectives | Maintain active leadership communication | Risk supports business, not the reverse |

## Gotchas

- **Governance versus management**: Governance provides oversight and risk
  optimization for stakeholders. Management implements goals set by governance.
  They are not the same.

- **Risk tolerance versus risk capacity**: Often confused. Operating within
  tolerance is manageable with compensating controls. Exceeding capacity
  threatens organizational existence.

- **Policies versus technology**: Policies are business decisions, not
  technical ones. Technology determines how policies are implemented.

- **Risk management alignment**: Align risk management with business objectives,
  not vice versa. Risk exists to support business.

- **Culture trumps training**: No amount of training works if risk culture is
  not communicated from the top and exhibited by leadership.

- **Cost of controls**: Control implementation costs should never exceed asset
  value. A $1,000 lock on a $500 bicycle makes no sense.

- **Exception management**: Policy deviations acceptable when enabling business
  objectives. Require explicit business process owner approval and central
  logging.

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| CRISC Governance domain weight | 26% | Approximately 39 exam questions |
| Experience requirement | 3 years minimum | In at least 2 of 4 CRISC domains |
| Policy review frequency | Annual minimum | Or after major business/infrastructure changes |
| Exception review | Annual | Remove unnecessary policy exceptions |
| Risk acceptance ceiling | Risk capacity | May exceed appetite/tolerance but never capacity |
| Data disposal standard | NIST 800-88 | Industry-standard media sanitization |

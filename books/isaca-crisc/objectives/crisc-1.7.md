# 1.7: Promote a risk-aware culture aligned with enterprise risk management

Source: ISACA Certified in Risk and Information Systems Control (CRISC) Exam Guide

## Key concepts

- **Risk-aware culture**: A common set of practices and processes, supported by
  enabling technologies, that improves decision-making and performance through
  an integrated view of how well an organization manages its unique set of
  risks.
  - GRC success depends on risk-aware culture permeating the organization
  - Culture directly impacts employee behavior toward policies and standards

- **Organizational risk culture maturity levels**: Five stages of progression:
  - **Vulnerable**: Neither senior management nor employees care about risk;
    response is always reactive after risk materializes
  - **Reactive**: Response based on employee complaints or contractual/
    compliance obligations
  - **Compliant**: Responsibilities defined but response driven by external
    compliance requirements (HIPAA, SOX)
  - **Proactive**: Senior management informed about risks and provides
    sufficient sponsorship and resources
  - **Resilient**: Clear accountabilities established and communicated;
    risk management emphasized in everything the organization does

- **Tone from the top**: Senior management must communicate and exhibit
  risk-driven culture. Leadership sponsorship is the most important factor in
  establishing a resilient culture toward risk.
  - "Tone from the top" (preferred) reflects behaviors for employees to follow
  - No amount of training works if leadership does not model risk awareness

- **Enterprise risk management (ERM)**: The integration of individual risk
  programs across the enterprise. IT risk strategy is an essential part of ERM
  as it supports all key functions and business objectives.
  - IT risk manager must be acquainted with ERM program
  - Roles and responsibilities defined using RACI model

- **Three lines of defense (3LoD)**: Organizational structure for risk
  management accountability:
  - First LoD: Operational management (owns and manages risk)
  - Second LoD: Risk monitoring and oversight (develops KRIs, monitors
    compliance)
  - Third LoD: Independent assurance (internal/external audit)

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| New risk manager joining organization | Understand organizational culture before drafting risk strategy | Culture determines how risk initiatives will be received and adopted |
| Leadership does not prioritize risk | Escalate to demonstrate business impact; seek executive sponsorship | Without leadership buy-in, risk programs fail regardless of technical merit |
| Employees bypass security controls | Address through awareness training and leadership modeling, not just technical controls | Culture change requires visible leadership commitment |
| Annual ethics training completed but no behavior change | Integrate ethics into daily operations rather than check-the-box compliance | Ethics must be inherent in culture, not a yearly seminar |
| Determining risk appetite | Align with business objectives; translate into standards and policies | Risk appetite must support value creation while containing risk within acceptable boundaries |

## Gotchas

- **Risk tolerance vs risk capacity**: Risk tolerance allows slight deviation
  from acceptable risk levels; risk capacity is the maximum risk before
  organizational existence is threatened. Both must always be less than risk
  capacity.

- **Accountability vs responsibility**: Senior management is accountable for
  risk culture and classification; operational staff are responsible for
  execution. Exam questions distinguish between who is accountable (owns the
  outcome) versus who is responsible (performs the work).

- **Policies are business decisions, not technical ones**: Technology determines
  how policies are implemented, but policy creation is a governance function
  driven by business objectives.

- **KRIs must be actionable**: Key Risk Indicators reported to stakeholders
  must enable decision-making. Non-actionable KRIs provide no value to senior
  management.

- **Ethics and culture are inseparable**: Ethics is not a check-the-box
  function. Good ethics must be an organization's cultural way of life, modeled
  from the top.

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Security awareness training frequency | Within 30 days of onboarding, then annually | Minimum cadence for maintaining risk-aware behavior |
| Risk assessment frequency | At least annually | May be quarterly based on risk culture and requirements |
| Risk acceptance review | Annual minimum | All documented exceptions must be revisited |
| Risk capacity threshold | Organization-specific | Exceeding capacity threatens continued existence |

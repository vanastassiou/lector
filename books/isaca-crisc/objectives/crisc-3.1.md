# 3.1: Consult with risk owners to align risk responses with organizational objectives

Source: ISACA Certified in Risk and Information Systems Control (CRISC) Exam Guide

## Key concepts

- **Risk owner**: Manager or executive responsible for a specific risk who can
  provide budget, resources, and authority to mandate risk responses. The
  business owner is typically the risk owner under the Three Lines of Defense
  (3LoD) model.
  - Drives accountability for risk remediation
  - Must be recorded in the risk register
  - Should be able to speak with authority on risk response
  - Owns the loss incurred if the risk scenario materializes

- **Risk response alignment**: The process of ensuring risk treatment
  strategies support organizational goals and business objectives rather than
  operating in isolation.
  - Risk appetite must align with business objectives
  - High-risk areas providing more value should receive more resources
  - Response strategies should translate into standards and policies

- **Cost-benefit analysis**: Required evaluation comparing the cost of
  implementing controls against the cost of the associated risks.
  - Cost of mitigating a risk should be less than the effective risk
  - Example: A $1,000 lock on a $500 bicycle does not make sense

- **Return-on-investment thesis**: Business justification presented to senior
  management to support a proposed risk response strategy.

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Risk impacts multiple business units | Assign single risk owner who can provide budget and expertise | Ensures clear accountability and decision authority |
| Cost of remediation exceeds asset value | Consider risk acceptance with documented compensating controls | Control cost should not outweigh protected asset value |
| Third-party vendor data not encrypted | Present cost-benefit analysis to business owner for acceptance decision | Allows informed risk-based decision aligned with objectives |
| Risk response requires significant resources | Prepare business case with ROI thesis for senior management | Enables informed decision on resource allocation |
| Risk exceeds risk appetite but within tolerance | Document exception with countermeasures and executive sign-off | Maintains governance while enabling business flexibility |

## Gotchas

- **Trap: Treating risk response as purely technical**: Risk response requires
  stakeholder buy-in and alignment with business objectives, not just
  implementing controls.

- **Trap: Eliminating risk entirely**: The goal of risk response is not to
  eliminate risk but to optimize it to acceptable levels where risk can become
  opportunity.

- **Trap: Risk tolerance equals risk capacity**: Risk tolerance is acceptable
  deviation from appetite; risk capacity is the maximum risk before
  organizational existence is threatened. Never exceed capacity.

- **Trap: Single response strategy**: Different risks demand different
  responses (mitigate, accept, transfer, avoid). A risk manager may combine
  strategies for optimization.

- **Trap: Same owner for risk and control**: While acceptable in smaller
  organizations, this should be avoided to maintain segregation of duties.

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Risk acceptance review | Annual minimum | Revisit original asset value and current risk level |
| Risk register requirement | Single owner per risk | Each risk must have one accountable owner |
| Risk exception documentation | Required fields | Risk owner, countermeasures, duration, executive sign-off |
| Risk capacity boundary | Never exceed | Crossing risk capacity threatens organizational existence |

## Related topics

- **Risk response strategies**: Four strategies (mitigate, accept, transfer,
  avoid) that risk owners must evaluate and approve for their risks.

- **Three Lines of Defense**: Framework defining risk ownership where first
  line (business owners) are ultimate risk owners, second line provides
  oversight, and third line provides independent assurance.

- **Risk appetite and tolerance**: Boundaries set by senior management that
  constrain acceptable risk responses and guide risk owner decisions.

- **Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)**: Metrics developed by second line of defense
  to communicate credible threats to stakeholders and inform risk response
  decisions.

- **Control ownership**: Separate from risk ownership; the person implementing
  or overseeing control effectiveness. Should be documented in risk register
  when identified.

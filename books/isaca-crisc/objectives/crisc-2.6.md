# 2.6: Determine risk appetite and tolerance aligned with business objectives

Source: CRISC Certified in Risk and Information Systems Control All-in-One Exam Guide

## Key concepts

- **Risk appetite**: The amount of risk an organization is willing to accept
  to achieve its objectives
  - Set by the board of directors or senior management
  - Documented in a risk appetite statement that guides the risk management
    team
  - Must be agreed upon with relevant stakeholders
  - Translated into standards and policies to contain risk within defined
    boundaries

- **Risk tolerance**: The acceptable level of variation that management is
  willing to allow to achieve its objectives
  - Represents a slight deviation from acceptable risk levels
  - An organization operating beyond risk appetite but within risk tolerance
    is manageable with compensating controls
  - Different from risk appetite--they are not interchangeable terms

- **Risk capacity**: The amount of risk an organization can afford to take
  without its continued existence being called into question
  - The absolute maximum threshold
  - Risk appetite and tolerance should always be less than risk capacity
  - Exceeding risk capacity threatens organizational survival

- **Risk profile**: The overall risk exposure of the organization to any type
  of risk
  - Factors affecting the profile: regulations, technology changes, business
    objective changes, mergers and acquisitions, competitors
  - IT risk profile: overall identified IT risk to which the enterprise is
    exposed
  - Ever-changing; requires continuous monitoring

- **Risk appetite statement**: A formal document from the board of directors
  stating the level of risk the organization is willing to accept
  - Guides risk mitigation strategies
  - Risk management team develops strategies that align with this statement
  - Should not be ignored or contradicted by risk management approaches

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Board sets moderate risk appetite for higher returns | Develop risk mitigation strategies that align with stated appetite | Risk appetite statement guides acceptable risk levels |
| Risk exceeds appetite but remains within tolerance | Accept with compensating controls in place | Tolerance allows slight deviation if controls mitigate exposure |
| Risk approaches capacity threshold | Immediate escalation and remediation | Exceeding capacity threatens organizational existence |
| Business conditions change | Review and adjust risk appetite boundaries | Boundaries must align with current business objectives |
| Third-party vendor data is not encrypted at rest | Perform cost-benefit analysis; accept if remediation cost exceeds potential loss | Risk acceptance requires business owner sign-off and compensating controls |

## Gotchas

- **Risk tolerance and risk capacity are not interchangeable**: Tolerance is
  acceptable variation from appetite; capacity is the maximum the organization
  can survive

- **Risk acceptance can exceed risk appetite and tolerance**: This is
  permissible with formal approval, but it must never exceed risk capacity

- **Low risk appetite with high tolerance is valid**: The organization prefers
  fewer risks but can accept moderate risk to achieve objectives

- **Risk appetite does not mean rejecting all risky proposals**: The risk
  management team develops strategies to manage risks within the appetite, not
  avoid all risk

- **Ignoring the risk appetite statement is incorrect**: Risk management must
  align with the board's stated risk appetite

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Risk acceptance review frequency | Annual minimum | All exceptions should be revisited at least annually |
| Risk appetite boundary review | With changing business conditions | Boundaries need regular adjustment or confirmation |
| Risk capacity threshold | Never exceed | Exceeding threatens organizational existence |

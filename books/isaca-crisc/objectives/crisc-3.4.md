# 3.4: Establish accountability by assigning control ownership

Source: ISACA Certified in Risk and Information Systems Control (CRISC) Exam Guide

## Key concepts

- **Control owner**: The individual responsible for implementing a control to
  mitigate risk or overseeing the control's effectiveness
  - Must be identified for each control in the organization
  - Should be recorded in the risk register as soon as identified
  - Unlike risk owners, control owners may not be determinable at the time of
    risk assessment
  - Responsible for ensuring controls remain current as risks evolve

- **Risk owner**: A manager or executive committee member accountable for risk
  treatment decisions
  - Provides budget and mandates risk response based on practitioner guidance
  - Owns the loss incurred if a risk scenario materializes
  - Must be a single individual who can speak with authority on risk response

- **RACI model**: Framework for establishing roles and responsibilities
  - **Responsible**: Individual or team performing the work
  - **Accountable**: Individual providing resources and answerable for success
  - **Consulted**: Subject matter experts with domain knowledge
  - **Informed**: Stakeholders affected by outcomes

- **Three Lines of Defense (3LoD)**: Model ensuring segregation and
  accountability
  - First line: Operational management (ultimate risk owners)
  - Second line: Risk monitoring and oversight functions
  - Third line: Internal and external audit

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Risk impacts multiple business units | Assign ownership to leader who can provide budget, resources, and expertise | Single point of accountability prevents confusion |
| Small organization with limited staff | Same person may serve as both risk owner and control owner | Acceptable when resources constrain separation |
| Control owner cannot be determined during assessment | Record in risk register as soon as identified post-assessment | Ensures eventual accountability even if delayed |
| Controls becoming outdated | Control owner monitors and updates as threat landscape changes | Prevents degradation of control effectiveness |

## Gotchas

- **Risk owner and control owner should be separate**: While acceptable for the
  same person to hold both roles, this should be avoided to maintain
  segregation of duties. Common in smaller organizations but creates potential
  conflict of interest.

- **Accountability versus responsibility**: The accountable party provides
  resources and answers for success; the responsible party performs the work.
  Confusing these leads to unclear ownership.

- **Control efficacy testing**: The control owner bears responsibility for
  periodic control testing and evaluation, not the risk owner. This includes
  both progressive testing (from requirements forward) and regressive testing
  (from results backward).

- **Risk ownership exists even without explicit assignment**: In the 3LoD
  model, business owners are inherently risk owners because they manage
  day-to-day operations. Failure to formally assign ownership does not
  eliminate accountability.

- **Risk transfer does not transfer accountability**: Outsourcing services or
  purchasing insurance transfers financial risk but reputational damage remains
  with the organization.

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Risk owners per risk | One | Single point of accountability required |
| Control review frequency | Annual minimum | Risk acceptance must be revisited at least yearly |
| Risk register fields for ownership | Risk owner, control owner | Both should be captured when known |
| 3LoD first line | Business/operational managers | Ultimate risk owners by default |

## Related topics

- **Risk register**: Central repository where risk and control owners must be
  documented; serves as system of record for accountability
- **Segregation of duties**: Principle requiring separation of risk ownership
  from control ownership where feasible
- **Control testing**: Periodic evaluation responsibility falling to the
  control owner to ensure continued effectiveness
- **Risk response strategies**: Mitigate, accept, transfer, avoid -- decisions
  requiring risk owner approval
- **Post-implementation review**: Control owner responsibility to verify
  implemented controls function as intended

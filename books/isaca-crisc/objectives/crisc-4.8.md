# 4.8: Security awareness training programs

Source: CRISC Certified in Risk and Information Systems Control Exam Guide

## Key concepts

- **Security awareness training**: A critical component of an organization's
  cybersecurity strategy designed to educate employees on identifying and
  mitigating potential security risks and threats
  - Promotes a culture of security throughout the organization
  - Targets the human element, which is involved in 82% of breaches (Verizon
    2022 Data Breach Investigations Report)
  - Best preventive control against insider threats

- **Training frequency requirements**:
  - Initial training within 30 days of onboarding
  - Annual refresher training thereafter at minimum
  - Additional role-based training for specific job functions
  - Privileged user training for those with elevated access

- **Security-conscious culture**: The primary goal of security awareness
  training
  - Employees understand the importance of security
  - Staff adopt best practices proactively
  - Personnel report suspicious activities without hesitation
  - Security reinforced at all organizational levels

- **Control classification of security awareness training**:
  - Deterrent control: discourages malicious actions before they occur
  - Administrative control: relies on policies and procedures rather than
    technical measures
  - Preventive control when addressing insider threats

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Employees falling for phishing attacks | Implement security awareness training | Social engineering attacks rely on human behavior; training helps employees recognize and resist manipulation |
| New online banking platform deployment | MFA is most important control, but training supplements | Technical controls address transaction risk; training addresses user behavior |
| Implementing new data classification policy | Conduct security awareness training for employees | Ensures staff understand the policy and can implement it properly |
| Managing mobile device risks | MDM solution is primary; training is supplementary | Training alone is insufficient; technical controls required for comprehensive mobile security |
| Protecting against social engineering | Provide security awareness training to employees | Social engineering exploits human psychology, making education the most effective defense |

## Gotchas

- **Primary purpose misconception**: The primary purpose of security awareness
  training is to develop a security-conscious culture, not merely to teach
  employees to recognize threats or use security tools

- **Control type confusion**: Security awareness training is classified as a
  deterrent control and administrative control, not a preventive or technical
  control

- **Standalone effectiveness**: Training alone is insufficient for some risks
  (mobile devices, technical vulnerabilities); must be combined with technical
  controls

- **Not a compensating control**: Encryption is a compensating control;
  security awareness training is not

- **Not a risk management component**: Conducting vulnerability scans is a key
  risk management activity; security awareness training is part of the broader
  security program

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Initial training deadline | 30 days | From employee onboarding date |
| Minimum recurring frequency | Annually | At least once per year |
| Breach involvement (human element) | 82% | Verizon 2022 DBIR statistic |

- **Social engineering attacks**: Training is the primary defense against
  phishing, pretexting, and baiting
- **Insider threats**: Malicious insiders pose the greatest threat; training is
  the best preventive control
- **Key risk indicators (KRIs)**: Employees untrained in security awareness
  continuing to fall for phishing is an example KRI
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework Protect function**: Security awareness
  training is a core activity within the Protect function
- **Administrative vs. technical controls**: Training is administrative; access
  control lists are technical
- **Data classification policies**: Training ensures employees understand and
  implement classification requirements

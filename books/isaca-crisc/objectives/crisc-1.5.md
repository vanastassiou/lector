# 1.5: Establish and maintain IT risk register integrated with enterprise risk profile

Source: ISACA Certified in Risk and Information Systems Control (CRISC) Exam Guide

## Key concepts

- **Risk register**: A central repository documenting all identified risks from
  risk assessments. Can be a sophisticated SaaS tool or a spreadsheet. Serves
  as the single source of truth for organizational risk tracking.
  - Minimum required fields: threats, vulnerabilities, likelihood, impact,
    inherent risk, current controls, residual risk, countermeasures, risk owner
  - Should be a live document updated when risk changes due to internal or
    external factors
  - Immediate output of any completed risk assessment

- **Risk catalog**: The collection of all documented risks in the risk
  register. Provides a baseline for the risk assessment program. Industry risk
  catalogs can be leveraged to establish initial risk baselines.

- **Enterprise risk profile**: The overall risk exposure of the organization
  across all risk types. Factors affecting the profile include:
  - New regulations
  - Technology changes
  - Business objective changes
  - Mergers and acquisitions
  - Direct and indirect competitors

- **IT risk profile**: The subset of enterprise risk focused on IT-specific
  exposures. Influenced by:
  - Emerging threats
  - Internal and external malicious actors
  - Incidents
  - IT regulations and privacy frameworks
  - New or acquired assets
  - Supply chain risks

- **Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)**: The umbrella program combining all
  individual risk programs across departments. IT risk managers must be
  acquainted with ERM and establish roles using tools like RACI.

- **Risk owner**: A manager or executive accountable for risk treatment
  decisions. Must be recorded in the risk register for each identified risk.
  - Provides budget and mandate for risk response
  - Owns the loss incurred if risk materializes
  - Should be a single individual per risk for clear accountability

- **Control owner**: The individual responsible for implementing and
  maintaining a specific control. Should be noted in the risk register when
  identified. Ideally separate from risk owner to maintain segregation of
  duties.

## Common scenarios

| Scenario | Correct approach | Why |
| -------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Risk impacts multiple business units | Assign owner who can provide budget, resources, and expertise | Single accountability enables effective remediation |
| Risk cannot be immediately remediated | Create Corrective Action Plan (CAP) with owner, timeline, and actions | Ensures tracking and eventual resolution |
| Same person as risk and control owner | Acceptable but should be avoided | Segregation of duties maintains oversight integrity |
| New IT risk identified | Enter into risk register with all required fields and link to enterprise risk | Maintains integrated view of organizational risk |
| Risk profile changes due to external factors | Update risk register and re-prioritize | Register must reflect current state |

## Gotchas

- **Risk register is not comprehensive**: A limitation of risk registers is
  they may not capture all risks facing an organization. Emerging risks or
  those not yet identified will be missing.

- **Confusing BIA with risk assessment**: BIA identifies critical business
  processes for recovery prioritization. Risk assessment identifies threats and
  controls. Both feed the risk register but serve different purposes.

- **Ignoring risk reporting phase**: Often overlooked but equally important.
  Key findings must be communicated to stakeholders after the risk treatment
  cycle completes.

- **No designated risk owner**: Without a risk owner, accountability is lost
  and risks go unnoticed. Every risk in the register must have an assigned
  owner.

- **Static risk register**: The register should be continuously updated when
  technology, threats, or business objectives change. A stale register provides
  false assurance.

## Limits and defaults

| Item | Value | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Risk acceptance review | Annual minimum | Reassess asset value and current risk level |
| KRIs | Actionable | Non-actionable KRIs provide no value to management |
| Risk response strategies | 4 types | Mitigate, accept, transfer, avoid |
| Control cost threshold | Less than effective risk | Cost of mitigation must not exceed risk value |

  that inform register thresholds and escalation criteria
- **Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)**: Metrics derived from register data to monitor
  and report on risk profile changes
- **Three Lines of Defense**: First line owns risks, second line develops KRIs
  and monitors, third line audits the process
- **Inherent and residual risk**: Register tracks both states; residual =
  inherent minus implemented controls

  roles for risk management activities

## Domain 1: Governance (26%)

### 1.1: Organizational governance principles

**Key concepts**

- **Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)**: Integrated approach
  - Governance: Direction and oversight
  - Risk management: Identifying and treating risks
  - Compliance: Meeting external requirements
- **IT governance frameworks**: COBIT, ISO 38500
  - Align IT with business objectives
  - Enable value delivery

**Exam scenarios**

| When | Do | Because |
| ---- | -- | ------- |
| IT spending misaligned with business | Implement IT governance | Ensures strategic alignment |
| Multiple compliance requirements | Integrate into GRC | Reduces duplication |
| Board lacks IT oversight | Establish governance structure | Accountability at top |

**Gotchas**

- **Governance is not management**: Governance directs; management executes
- **Compliance alone is not governance**: Compliance is one governance component

### 1.2: Organizational strategy and objectives

**Key concepts**

- **Strategic alignment**: Risk management supports business goals
  - Risk appetite derived from strategy
  - Risk decisions enable rather than block objectives
- **Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)**: Organization-wide risk view
  - Breaks down silos
  - Portfolio approach to risk

**Exam scenarios**

| When | Do | Because |
| ---- | -- | ------- |
| Risk decision conflicts with strategy | Escalate for strategic review | Strategy guides risk decisions |
| Departmental risk silos | Implement ERM | Enterprise view of risk |
| New business initiative | Assess risk alignment | Enable informed decision |

**Gotchas**

- **Risk management is not risk avoidance**: Taking calculated risks drives growth
- **Strategy changes require risk reassessment**: Static risk assessment becomes
  outdated

### 1.3: Risk appetite, tolerance, and capacity

**Key concepts**

- **Risk appetite**: Amount of risk organization willing to accept
  - Strategic-level statement
  - Set by board/senior management
- **Risk tolerance**: Acceptable variation from risk appetite
  - Operational boundaries
  - Measured per risk or category
- **Risk capacity**: Maximum risk organization can absorb
  - Based on resources, capital, capabilities
  - Upper boundary regardless of appetite

**Exam scenarios**

| When | Do | Because |
| ---- | -- | ------- |
| Risk exceeds tolerance | Escalate or treat immediately | Operating outside boundaries |
| Setting risk appetite | Involve board | Strategic decision requiring authority |
| Startup vs mature company | Expect different appetites | Business context affects willingness |

**Gotchas**

- **Appetite vs tolerance**: Appetite is what you want; tolerance is what you
  allow
- **Capacity constrains appetite**: Cannot have appetite exceeding capacity

### 1.4: Three lines of defense model

**Key concepts**

- **First line**: Business operations (risk owners)
  - Owns and manages risks daily
  - Implements controls
- **Second line**: Risk management and compliance functions
  - Provides frameworks, policies, oversight
  - Monitors and challenges first line
- **Third line**: Internal audit
  - Independent assurance
  - Reports to audit committee

**Exam scenarios**

| When | Do | Because |
| ---- | -- | ------- |
| Control implementation question | First line responsibility | Operational control ownership |
| Risk policy development | Second line responsibility | Framework and oversight role |
| Independent assessment needed | Third line performs | Assurance requires independence |

**Gotchas**

- **Second line advises, does not own**: Ownership remains with first line
- **External audit is not fourth line**: Supplements but differs from third line

### 1.5: Risk management program development

**Key concepts**

- **Program components**:
  - Charter and scope
  - Roles and responsibilities
  - Policies and procedures
  - Risk assessment methodology
  - Reporting requirements
- **Program lifecycle**: Establish, implement, monitor, improve

**Exam scenarios**

| When | Do | Because |
| ---- | -- | ------- |
| Starting risk program | Define charter first | Establishes authority and scope |
| Program not effective | Assess maturity, identify gaps | Continuous improvement |
| Inconsistent risk assessments | Standardize methodology | Enables comparison and aggregation |

**Gotchas**

- **Program requires executive sponsorship**: Without it, lacks authority
- **Documentation alone is not a program**: Must be operationalized

### 1.6: Legal, regulatory, and contractual requirements

**Key concepts**

- **Compliance drivers**:
  - Laws and regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, SOX)
  - Industry standards (PCI DSS)
  - Contractual obligations
- **Compliance risk**: Non-compliance consequences
  - Financial penalties, legal action
  - Reputational damage

**Exam scenarios**

| When | Do | Because |
| ---- | -- | ------- |
| New regulation enacted | Assess impact, update controls | Maintain compliance |
| Customer requires certification | Pursue if business justified | Contractual requirement |
| Multiple jurisdictions | Map requirements, harmonize controls | Efficient compliance |

**Gotchas**

- **Compliance is not security**: Compliant organizations can still be breached
- **Regulations evolve**: Static compliance programs become non-compliant

### 1.7: Risk culture and policy

**Key concepts**

- **Policy hierarchy**:
  - Policies: High-level intent (what)
  - Standards: Specific requirements (how much)
  - Procedures: Step-by-step instructions (how)
  - Guidelines: Recommendations (suggestions)
- **Policy lifecycle**: Draft, review, approve, publish, maintain, retire

**Exam scenarios**

| When | Do | Because |
| ---- | -- | ------- |
| Conflicting guidance | Check policy hierarchy | Higher level takes precedence |
| Policy not followed | Assess awareness and enforcement | Policy without enforcement ineffective |
| Annual review due | Update for changes, re-approve | Policies require maintenance |

**Gotchas**

- **Guidelines are not mandatory**: Distinguish from standards
- **Policy exceptions need approval**: Unapproved deviations are violations

## Domain 2: Risk assessment (22%)

### 2.1: Risk identification methods

**Key concepts**

- **Identification techniques**:
  - Interviews and workshops
  - Questionnaires and surveys
  - Process analysis
  - Historical data review
- **Risk sources**: Internal, external, strategic, operational

**Exam scenarios**

| When | Do | Because |
| ---- | -- | ------- |
| New system implementation | Conduct risk workshop | Identify risks early |
| Limited stakeholder access | Use questionnaires | Gather input asynchronously |
| Recurring incidents | Analyze historical data | Pattern identification |

**Gotchas**

- **Single method insufficient**: Combine techniques for completeness
- **Identified risks may not be complete**: Unknown risks always exist

### 2.2: Threats and vulnerabilities

**Key concepts**

- **Threat**: Potential cause of unwanted incident
  - Threat actors: Hackers, insiders, natural events
  - Threat intelligence: External feeds, industry sharing
- **Vulnerability**: Weakness exploitable by threat
  - Technical: Unpatched software
  - Process: Inadequate procedures
  - People: Lack of training

**Exam scenarios**

| When | Do | Because |
| ---- | -- | ------- |
| Assessing likelihood | Consider threat and vulnerability together | Risk requires both |
| New vulnerability disclosed | Assess threat actor interest | Prioritize patching |
| Threat intelligence received | Map to organizational vulnerabilities | Targeted response |

**Gotchas**

- **Vulnerability without threat is low risk**: Context matters
- **All systems have vulnerabilities**: Prioritization is essential

### 2.3: Risk scenario development

**Key concepts**

- **Scenario components**:
  - Threat actor and motivation
  - Vulnerability exploited
  - Asset affected
  - Impact on business
- **Scenario types**: Current state, emerging, hypothetical

**Exam scenarios**

| When | Do | Because |
| ---- | -- | ------- |
| Communicating risk to business | Use scenarios | Concrete narratives resonate |
| Assessing emerging technology | Develop hypothetical scenarios | Anticipate new risks |
| Quantifying risk | Build detailed scenarios | Enables estimation |

**Gotchas**

- **Scenarios are not predictions**: Explore possibilities, not certainties
- **Too many scenarios overwhelm**: Focus on significant risks

### 2.4: Risk assessment frameworks

**Key concepts**

- **Qualitative assessment**: Categorical ratings (high/medium/low)
  - Faster, less data required
  - Subjective, difficult to compare
- **Quantitative assessment**: Numerical values
  - FAIR (Factor Analysis of Information Risk)
  - Requires historical data, more precise
- **Frameworks**: NIST 800-30, ISO 27005, COBIT

**Exam scenarios**

| When | Do | Because |
| ---- | -- | ------- |
| Limited data available | Use qualitative | Quantitative requires data |
| Justifying control investment | Use quantitative | Financial terms for ROI |
| Initial risk assessment | Qualitative then quantitative for high risks | Efficient prioritization |

**Gotchas**

- **Qualitative is not less valid**: Appropriate for many contexts
- **Quantitative precision is not accuracy**: Garbage in, garbage out

### 2.5: Business impact analysis

**Key concepts**

- **BIA metrics**:
  - **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)**: Maximum tolerable downtime
  - **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)**: Maximum tolerable data loss
  - **MTD (Maximum Tolerable Downtime)**: Point of business failure
- **BIA process**: Identify critical processes, determine dependencies,
  establish recovery priorities

**Exam scenarios**

| When | Do | Because |
| ---- | -- | ------- |
| RPO is 1 hour | Backup at least hourly | Meet data loss objective |
| RTO exceeds MTD | Redesign recovery approach | Business will fail |
| Process dependencies unclear | Map dependencies in BIA | Recovery order matters |

**Gotchas**

- **RTO is not RTD**: Objective vs actual recovery time
- **MTD drives RTO**: RTO must be less than MTD

### 2.6: Inherent and residual risk

**Key concepts**

- **Inherent risk**: Risk before controls applied
  - Theoretical risk level
  - Baseline for control assessment
- **Residual risk**: Risk remaining after controls
  - Must be within risk tolerance
  - Subject to risk acceptance
- **Current risk**: Actual risk with current control effectiveness
  - May differ from expected residual

**Exam scenarios**

| When | Do | Because |
| ---- | -- | ------- |
| Control not operating effectively | Current risk exceeds expected residual | Adjust assessment |
| High inherent, low residual | Controls are effective | Good control investment |
| Residual exceeds tolerance | Additional treatment or accept | Decision required |

**Gotchas**

- **Zero residual risk impossible**: Some risk always remains
- **Inherent risk can change**: Not static over time

### 2.7: Risk analysis and evaluation

**Key concepts**

- **Likelihood determination**: Probability of risk occurrence
  - Historical data, threat intelligence
  - Control effectiveness
- **Impact assessment**: Consequence magnitude
  - Financial, operational, reputational, regulatory
  - Primary and secondary impacts
- **Risk rating**: Likelihood x Impact matrix

**Exam scenarios**

| When | Do | Because |
| ---- | -- | ------- |
| High impact, low likelihood | May still require treatment | Impact severity matters |
| Aggregating risks | Consider correlation | Independent risks aggregate differently |
| Conflicting assessments | Facilitate consensus | Consistent ratings needed |

**Gotchas**

- **Likelihood is not frequency**: Probability per time period
- **Impact categories compound**: Breach causes financial and reputational harm

## Domain 3: Risk response and reporting (32%)

### 3.1: Risk treatment/risk response options

**Key concepts**

- **Risk mitigation**: Reduce risk likelihood or impact through controls
  - Most common response strategy
  - Controls should be cost-effective relative to risk reduction
- **Risk acceptance**: Acknowledge risk without additional controls
  - Appropriate when cost of mitigation exceeds potential loss
  - Requires formal documentation and management approval
- **Risk transfer**: Shift risk to third party
  - Insurance, outsourcing, contracts
  - Does not eliminate risk--residual risk remains
- **Risk avoidance**: Eliminate activity causing risk
  - Most effective but may sacrifice business opportunity
  - Last resort when other options inadequate

**Exam scenarios**

| When | Do | Because |
| ---- | -- | ------- |
| Control cost exceeds potential loss | Accept the risk | Cost-benefit analysis favors acceptance |
| High-impact, low-frequency risk | Transfer via insurance | Spreads financial impact |
| Risk exceeds risk appetite | Avoid the activity | No acceptable treatment available |
| Cost-effective controls exist | Mitigate the risk | Reduces exposure within budget |

**Gotchas**

- **Transfer vs eliminate**: Insurance transfers financial impact, not the risk
  itself--operational consequences remain
- **Acceptance requires documentation**: Informal acceptance is non-compliance

### 3.2: Risk and control ownership

**Key concepts**

- **Risk owner**: Business executive accountable for risk decisions
  - Accepts residual risk on behalf of organization
  - Must have authority to allocate resources
- **Control owner**: Operational manager responsible for control operation
  - Ensures control functions as designed
  - Reports control effectiveness to risk owner
- **Separation of duties**: Risk and control owners should be different
  - Prevents conflicts of interest
  - Ensures independent validation

**Exam scenarios**

| When | Do | Because |
| ---- | -- | ------- |
| Identifying who approves risk acceptance | Assign risk owner | Only risk owner can accept residual risk |
| Control fails during audit | Contact control owner | Responsible for control operation |
| Risk treatment decision needed | Escalate to risk owner | Has decision authority |

**Gotchas**

- **IT is rarely the risk owner**: Business process owner typically owns risk
- **Control owner is not the control operator**: Ownership implies accountability,
  not execution

### 3.3: Third-party risk management

**Key concepts**

- **Vendor due diligence**: Assess third-party risk before engagement
  - Financial stability, security posture, compliance
  - Review SOC 2 reports, penetration test results
- **Contractual controls**: Security requirements in agreements
  - Right-to-audit clauses, SLAs, data handling requirements
  - Breach notification obligations
- **Ongoing monitoring**: Continuous assessment during relationship
  - Periodic reassessment, performance metrics
  - Subcontractor/fourth-party visibility

**Exam scenarios**

| When | Do | Because |
| ---- | -- | ------- |
| Selecting cloud provider | Require SOC 2 Type II report | Validates control effectiveness over time |
| Vendor handling PII | Include data protection clauses | Contractual accountability |
| Vendor subcontracts services | Assess fourth-party risk | Risk extends to subcontractors |

**Gotchas**

- **SOC 2 Type I vs Type II**: Type I is point-in-time; Type II covers 6-12 months
- **Outsourcing does not outsource risk**: Organization remains accountable

### 3.4: Control types, standards, and frameworks

**Key concepts**

- **Control types by function**:
  - **Preventive**: Stop incidents before occurrence (access controls, encryption)
  - **Detective**: Identify incidents during or after (logs, IDS, audits)
  - **Corrective**: Restore normal operations (backups, patches)
  - **Compensating**: Alternative when primary control infeasible
  - **Deterrent**: Discourage violations (warning banners, policies)
- **Control types by implementation**:
  - **Administrative**: Policies, procedures, training
  - **Technical**: Software, hardware, configuration
  - **Physical**: Locks, guards, environmental controls

**Exam scenarios**

| When | Do | Because |
| ---- | -- | ------- |
| Cannot implement segregation of duties | Apply compensating control | Addresses same risk differently |
| Detecting unauthorized access | Implement detective controls | Logs and monitoring identify violations |
| Reducing phishing risk | Combine training and email filters | Layered preventive approach |

**Gotchas**

- **Deterrent is not preventive**: Warning banners discourage but do not block
- **Compensating controls require justification**: Must document why primary
  control is infeasible

### 3.5: Control design, selection, and implementation

**Key concepts**

- **Control objectives**: What the control should achieve
  - Derived from risk assessment findings
  - Aligned with business requirements
- **Control design principles**:
  - Defense in depth: Multiple layers of controls
  - Least privilege: Minimum access necessary
  - Separation of duties: No single person controls entire process
- **Implementation considerations**:
  - Cost-benefit analysis
  - User impact and acceptance
  - Integration with existing controls

**Exam scenarios**

| When | Do | Because |
| ---- | -- | ------- |
| Single control point of failure | Add redundant controls | Defense in depth principle |
| High-value transaction | Require dual approval | Separation of duties |
| Control too restrictive for users | Balance security with usability | Overly restrictive controls get bypassed |

**Gotchas**

- **More controls is not better**: Over-control increases cost without
  proportional risk reduction
- **Control effectiveness vs efficiency**: Effective control may be inefficient

### 3.6: Control assessment and testing

**Key concepts**

- **Control testing methods**:
  - **Inquiry**: Ask personnel about control operation
  - **Observation**: Watch control in action
  - **Inspection**: Examine documentation, configurations
  - **Re-performance**: Execute control independently
- **Testing types**:
  - Design effectiveness: Control designed to address risk
  - Operating effectiveness: Control functioning as designed

**Exam scenarios**

| When | Do | Because |
| ---- | -- | ------- |
| Validating access review process | Re-perform sample review | Highest assurance level |
| Assessing new control | Test design first | No point testing operation if design flawed |
| Limited testing resources | Focus on high-risk areas | Risk-based testing prioritization |

**Gotchas**

- **Inquiry alone insufficient**: Must corroborate with other methods
- **Sample size matters**: Small samples may miss control failures

### 3.7: Control monitoring and reporting

**Key concepts**

- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: Measure control performance
  - Lagging indicators showing past performance
  - Example: Percentage of patches applied on time
- **Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)**: Signal changes in risk level
  - Leading indicators predicting risk events
  - Example: Number of failed login attempts
- **Key Control Indicators (KCIs)**: Measure control effectiveness
  - Example: Percentage of exceptions in access reviews

**Exam scenarios**

| When | Do | Because |
| ---- | -- | ------- |
| Predicting potential incidents | Monitor KRIs | Leading indicators of risk |
| Measuring control effectiveness | Track KCIs | Direct control performance measure |
| Reporting to management | Use KPIs | Business-oriented metrics |

**Gotchas**

- **KRI thresholds need tuning**: Too sensitive causes alert fatigue; too lax
  misses events
- **Correlation is not causation**: KRI changes may not indicate actual risk change

### 3.8: Security information and event management

**Key concepts**

- **SIEM components**:
  - Log aggregation: Centralized collection from multiple sources
  - Event correlation: Identify patterns across events
  - Alerting: Notify on threshold breaches
  - Reporting: Compliance and operational dashboards
- **Log retention**: Balance storage costs with compliance requirements
  - Regulatory minimums vary by industry
  - Consider forensic investigation needs

**Exam scenarios**

| When | Do | Because |
| ---- | -- | ------- |
| Detecting multi-stage attack | Use event correlation | Single logs miss coordinated attacks |
| Regulatory audit | Ensure log retention meets requirements | Non-compliance penalties |
| Too many alerts | Tune correlation rules | Reduce false positives |

**Gotchas**

- **SIEM is detective, not preventive**: Identifies incidents after occurrence
- **Log integrity required**: Tampered logs invalidate forensic evidence

### 3.9: IT risk reporting

**Key concepts**

- **Risk reporting formats**:
  - Heat maps: Visual risk prioritization by likelihood/impact
  - Dashboards: Real-time status indicators
  - Trend analysis: Risk changes over time
- **Reporting audiences**:

  - Management: Operational risk status, resource needs
  - Technical staff: Detailed findings, remediation tasks

**Exam scenarios**

| When | Do | Because |
| ---- | -- | ------- |
| Presenting to board | Use heat maps and trends | Strategic view, minimal detail |
| Tracking remediation | Use detailed reports | Action-oriented information |
| Comparing periods | Show trend analysis | Demonstrates program effectiveness |

**Gotchas**

- **Tailor to audience**: Technical details confuse executives
- **Risk aggregation**: Rolling up risks may hide critical individual risks

### 3.10: Risk register content and maintenance

**Key concepts**

- **Risk register elements**:
  - Risk ID, description, category
  - Likelihood and impact ratings
  - Inherent and residual risk scores
  - Risk owner, treatment plan, status
- **Maintenance activities**:

  - Update after incidents or control changes
  - Archive closed risks for trend analysis

**Exam scenarios**

| When | Do | Because |
| ---- | -- | ------- |
| New risk identified | Add to register immediately | Central repository for all risks |
| Risk treatment completed | Update residual risk score | Reflects current state |
| Annual risk review | Validate all entries | Ensures register accuracy |

**Gotchas**

- **Stale register worse than none**: Outdated information misleads decisions
- **Risk register is not static**: Living document requiring ongoing attention

### 3.11: Risk communication strategies

**Key concepts**

- **Communication principles**:
  - Clear, jargon-free language for non-technical audiences
  - Actionable recommendations
  - Consistent terminology across organization
- **Escalation procedures**:
  - Defined thresholds for escalation
  - Clear escalation paths
  - Timeframes for response

**Exam scenarios**

| When | Do | Because |
| ---- | -- | ------- |
| Critical risk identified | Follow escalation procedure | Timely awareness enables response |
| Communicating to business | Translate technical terms | Ensures understanding |
| Risk exceeds tolerance | Escalate to senior management | Authority to accept or treat |

**Gotchas**

- **Over-communication fatigues stakeholders**: Prioritize significant risks
- **Under-communication delays response**: Balance required

### 3.12: Risk culture and awareness

**Key concepts**

- **Risk culture elements**:
  - Tone at the top: Leadership demonstrates risk awareness
  - Accountability: Clear ownership at all levels
  - Open communication: Encouraged reporting without fear
- **Awareness programs**:
  - Regular training, phishing simulations
  - Risk-aware decision-making integration

**Exam scenarios**

| When | Do | Because |
| ---- | -- | ------- |
| Employees not reporting incidents | Improve culture | Fear of blame prevents reporting |
| New risk policy | Conduct training | Awareness enables compliance |
| Low engagement in training | Use varied methods | Different learning styles |

**Gotchas**

- **Policy without culture fails**: Written rules ignored without cultural support
- **One-time training insufficient**: Ongoing reinforcement required

### 3.13: Business impact analysis integration

**Key concepts**

- **BIA outputs used in risk response**:
  - Critical process identification
  - Recovery priorities (RTO, RPO, MTD)
  - Resource requirements
- **Risk treatment alignment**: Controls prioritized by business impact

**Exam scenarios**

| When | Do | Because |
| ---- | -- | ------- |
| Allocating control budget | Prioritize critical processes | BIA identifies what matters most |
| Setting recovery objectives | Use RTO/RPO from BIA | Business-driven requirements |
| Disaster recovery planning | Align with BIA priorities | Recover critical processes first |

**Gotchas**

- **BIA is not one-time**: Update when business changes
- **RTO vs MTD**: RTO must be less than MTD or business fails

### 3.14: Exception management

**Key concepts**

- **Exception process**:
  - Formal request with business justification
  - Risk assessment of exception
  - Compensating controls if applicable
  - Time-limited approval with expiration
- **Exception tracking**: Central repository, periodic review

**Exam scenarios**

| When | Do | Because |
| ---- | -- | ------- |
| Control cannot be implemented | Request exception with compensating controls | Formal process maintains accountability |
| Exception expires | Reassess and renew or remediate | Prevents permanent exceptions |
| Audit finds undocumented exception | Policy violation | All exceptions require documentation |

**Gotchas**

- **Permanent exceptions accumulate risk**: Time limits force reassessment
- **Business pressure for exceptions**: Risk owner must still approve

  - **IDS/IPS**: Signature-based, anomaly-based, behavior-based
  - **VPN**: Site-to-site, remote access
- **Network segmentation**: VLANs, DMZ, zero trust

**Exam scenarios**

| When | Do | Because |
| ---- | -- | ------- |
| Web server deployment | Place in DMZ | Isolate from internal network |
| Unknown attack detection | Use anomaly-based IDS | Signature-based misses zero-days |
| Remote workforce | Implement VPN | Secure communications |

**Gotchas**

- **IDS detects, IPS blocks**: Know the difference
- **Stateful firewall tracks sessions**: More secure than stateless

### 4.4: Cloud computing

**Key concepts**

- **Service models**:
  - IaaS: Infrastructure (compute, storage, network)
  - PaaS: Platform (runtime, middleware)
  - SaaS: Software (complete application)
- **Shared responsibility**: Security responsibilities vary by model
  - IaaS: Customer manages most
  - SaaS: Provider manages most

**Exam scenarios**

| ---- | -- | ------- |
| Assessing cloud security | Apply shared responsibility model | Understand who controls what |
| Choosing cloud model | Match to capability and needs | Different models suit different needs |
| Vendor lock-in concern | Assess portability | Multi-cloud strategy may help |

**Gotchas**

- **Cloud does not eliminate security responsibility**: Shifts, not removes
- **SaaS configuration still customer's job**: Default settings may be insecure

### 4.5: Disaster recovery and business continuity

**Key concepts**

- **DR/BC relationship**:
  - BC: Maintain operations during disruption
  - DR: Restore IT systems after failure
- **Recovery strategies**:
  - Hot site: Immediate failover
  - Warm site: Partial capability, hours to activate
  - Cold site: Empty facility, days to activate
- **Testing types**: Tabletop, walkthrough, simulation, full interruption

**Exam scenarios**

| When | Do | Because |
| ---- | -- | ------- |
| RTO under 4 hours | Hot or warm site needed | Cold site too slow |
| First DR test | Start with tabletop | Low risk, identifies gaps |
| Validating actual recovery | Full interruption test | Only way to confirm |

**Gotchas**

- **Backup is not DR**: Backup is component of DR strategy
- **DR plan must be tested**: Untested plans fail when needed

### 4.6: Data lifecycle management

**Key concepts**

- **Lifecycle phases**:
  - Creation: Classification at origin
  - Storage: Encryption, access controls
  - Use: Monitoring, DLP
  - Sharing: External transfer controls
  - Archiving: Long-term retention
  - Destruction: Secure disposal
- **Data classification**: Confidential, internal, public

**Exam scenarios**

| When | Do | Because |
| ---- | -- | ------- |
| Data leaving organization | Apply DLP controls | Prevent unauthorized transfer |
| End of retention period | Securely destroy | Compliance and risk reduction |
| New data created | Classify immediately | Enables appropriate controls |

**Gotchas**

- **Deletion is not destruction**: Deleted data often recoverable
- **Classification drives protection**: Wrong classification leads to wrong controls

### 4.7: System development lifecycle

**Key concepts**

- **SDLC phases**:
  - Initiation: Requirements, feasibility
  - Development/acquisition: Design, build, buy
  - Implementation: Testing, deployment
  - Operations/maintenance: Support, patching
  - Disposal: Decommissioning
- **Security integration**: Security requirements in each phase

**Exam scenarios**

| When | Do | Because |
| ---- | -- | ------- |
| New system project | Include security from initiation | Retrofitting costs more |
| Application retirement | Secure data disposal | Data persists in old systems |
| Development phase | Perform secure code review | Find vulnerabilities early |

**Gotchas**

- **Security at end is too late**: Shift left approach required
- **Maintenance is longest phase**: Most vulnerability patching here

### 4.8: Emerging technologies

**Key concepts**

- **BYOD**: Personal devices in enterprise
  - MDM (Mobile Device Management) controls
  - Containerization for data separation
- **IoT**: Internet-connected devices
  - Limited security capabilities
  - Network segmentation essential
- **AI/ML**: Automated decision-making
  - Model bias risks
  - Adversarial attacks
- **Blockchain**: Distributed ledger
  - Immutability, transparency
  - Smart contract vulnerabilities

**Exam scenarios**

| When | Do | Because |
| ---- | -- | ------- |
| BYOD implementation | Require MDM enrollment | Enable remote wipe, policy enforcement |
| IoT deployment | Segment on separate network | Limit blast radius |
| AI system decision | Ensure explainability | Accountability and bias detection |

**Gotchas**

- **New technology, new risks**: Risk assessment required before adoption
- **IoT devices rarely patched**: Plan for unpatched vulnerabilities

### 4.9: Cryptography and access control

**Key concepts**

- **CIA triad**:
  - Confidentiality: Encryption, access controls
  - Integrity: Hashing, digital signatures
  - Availability: Redundancy, backups
- **Cryptographic controls**:
  - Symmetric: Single key (AES)
  - Asymmetric: Key pairs (RSA)
  - Hashing: One-way function (SHA-256)
- **Access control principles**:
  - Need-to-know: Access only necessary information
  - Least privilege: Minimum permissions required

**Exam scenarios**

| When | Do | Because |
| ---- | -- | ------- |
| Data at rest | Encrypt with AES-256 | Industry standard, symmetric efficiency |
| Verifying data integrity | Use hash comparison | Detect unauthorized modification |
| Granting access | Apply least privilege | Minimize potential damage |

**Gotchas**

- **Encryption does not ensure integrity**: Encrypted data can be corrupted
- **Key management is critical**: Lost keys mean lost data

### 4.10: Privacy principles

**Key concepts**

- **Privacy principles** (GDPR, Fair Information Practices):
  - Purpose limitation: Collect for specified purpose
  - Data minimization: Collect only what's needed
  - Retention limitation: Keep only as long as needed
  - Individual rights: Access, correction, deletion
- **Privacy by design**: Privacy built into systems from start

**Exam scenarios**

| When | Do | Because |
| ---- | -- | ------- |
| Collecting personal data | Document purpose, limit collection | Purpose limitation, minimization |
| Data subject request | Respond within timeframe | Regulatory requirement |
| New system design | Include privacy controls | Privacy by design principle |

**Gotchas**

- **Consent is not always required**: Legal bases vary
- **Anonymization is difficult**: Re-identification often possible
